#### God’s proud of you, as He was yesterday

Before time, God made you; perfectly, He arranged every cell, saw each one of your days ([Psalm 139:13–16](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalm%20139:13-16&version=ESV)). He loved you before you were ever you. If God is perfect and He made you, how could you have been made anything less than perfectly? No, this is not who God is. He saw the plans He had for you and before the earth was created, He was proud. Today, God’s proud.

#### God’s proud of you today

We have the assurance that God is working all things for the good of those who love Him ([Romans 8:28–29](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans%208:28-29&version=ESV)). If this is true, and we are coming from a place of being prized in God’s heart, then how can it be that God would not be proud of you today? Yes, we fall down, get dirty, love lesser things, worship false gods, and sometimes each of these happens within the same hour. OK, maybe that’s just me, but you get where I’m going with that. We will mess up till the day each of us dies. However, God’s proud of you today. With each falling short, He whispers to our defiant heart, “I’m hurt, but I love you and I’m very proud of who you are and what you’re becoming. Come on, let’s go clean you up.” Today, God’s proud of you, friend.

#### God’s proud of you tomorrow, even

And if God’s plans for you truly are good, then why should God not be proud of you tomorrow? See, our place in God’s heart is a result of His unchanging grace and love. Because God is love, because God is good, our position as the daughters and sons of God has been secured forever. There is not a thing we could do to loose ourselves from His tremendous, everlasting love. He will never leave us. He will never forsake us. He is ours and we are His, forever and ever. For every tomorrow, we are reminded that God’s proud.

If God’s proud of us, what then have we to fear of the rejection of people? If God’s proud of us, who then can we ultimately let down? Sure, we will disappoint and fall short time and again, but our identity, our validation is secured in the One who secured the foundations of the universe. Before time, today, tomorrow, God’s proud of you, of us. Because of His love, His utter perfection, we will always remain the apple of His eye. There is nothing we need to do to earn that favor. It’s ours. It will always be ours. Now, let’s take that and move on to more important preoccupations with our lives. Go get ’em today, friend. God’s proud of you.
