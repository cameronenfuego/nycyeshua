> We’re all looking for a love that’s new, something exotic, fresh, that we never knew.  
> We wait for love to surprise out of the blue, most never realizing the youth that flew.  
> We look as all good movie characters do, for that one day we’ll be made complete me and you.  
> We’re all searching for love in this world, but did we know all along it was You?

**Searching high and low.** I stand before you today guilty of the very thing about which I protest. I’ve spent too much time searching desperately for a love to sweep me off my feet and carry me wistfully into the sunset. I’ve sought girls and bottles, bongs and other things, but have been left as empty as the bottle the morning after. I’ve searched high and low, but don’t feel much closer than when I started.

**I’m not the only one.** Just a quick glance online or at the people around you will show I’m not alone. I’m not the only one who bought into the fairy tale ending. I’m certainly not the only one frustrated I can’t find it. Just ask the thousands who are members of two or more dating sites. The search is maddening.

**Looking in all the wrong places.** People can only love you so much or for so long. That’s the fact of a finite being. As such, even my parents, amazing as can be, cannot love me enough to quench this need. No, there is not a human being who can fulfill this desire of my heart. Not a thing on this earth can quell the cries of my soul.

> “I lift up my eyes to the hills. From where does my help come? My help comes from the Lord, who made heaven and earth.” — Psalm 121:1–2

**I’ve found the One.** Downcast and brokenhearted, my search has led me here. There is only one who can love me deep as I need. Only one can love me every second of every minute of my life. I’ve found the One for whom my soul pants. Exotic, yes, this love is, but it is far from new. It’s the first love I ever knew, but I’m able to look at it with new eyes. Returning home from my wayward rebellion, I’m greeted by a Father overjoyed at the return of His lost son. Though I left Him, He’s waited patiently, grieving everyday until my return. And now that I’ve returned, there are no “I told you so”s, but only celebration and love. Love, true love, has always been right here.

> “In this is love, not that we have loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.” — 1 John 4:10

We all are allured by the shiny and new. It’s easy to lose sight of the things that have lost their shine. We’re all looking in our own ways for the One, the love in our lives to trump all others. We spend our lives searching for the Hollywood ending only to find ourselves alone and with that much less time. Inevitably, people, everyone, will let us down. However, God cannot as He is both infinite and perfect. He will not meet our expectations, but only because His are so much greater than our own. Sure you can search all your life, but only here will you find your Love. Friends, there is an end to this endless quest _looking for love_.
