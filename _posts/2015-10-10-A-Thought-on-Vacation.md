I’m about to go on vacation for a couple weeks with my wife and I’m really excited. What is it about vacation that we love so much? Well, duh, but the real question I am getting at is what is it about the rest of our lives, real life, that leaves us so ready to escape it to vacation land?<!--more-->

Perhaps I’m phoning this topic in, but it’s just where my head’s at. Why do I need this escape? What is it that I’m actually trying to distance myself from?

The getting-ready-for-vacation hamster wheel feels like madness to me. I get all worked up, trying to get life and work in order to leave. I have expended all this time and energy preparing my everyday life to run as smoothly as possible so I can go on vacation and get distance from my everyday life.

I spend much of my waking hours stressing myself out, perpetuating this breakneck pace. I’m then surprised when I feel like I need to get away from it and go on vacation.

Put another way, I spend most of my life perfecting the mask of my life, more completely hiding who I really am until I get stressed to the point where I need to get away. I go on vacation to leave it all behind and find myself by piling on as many experiences as I can fit into the itinerary. And I just return home tired, jet lagged, frustrated at how I feel even further from myself.

I’m oversimplifying this and ignoring a lot, but I think you get my point. What’s the sense in all this? Why can’t I just go on vacation for the sake of relaxing and enjoying?

I don’t think vacation needs to be an escape, so much as an extension of the rest of my life. But that would require a lot of me in my real life; taking a vacation in reality requires authenticity. And right now — maybe forever — authenticity seems to be the challenge.
