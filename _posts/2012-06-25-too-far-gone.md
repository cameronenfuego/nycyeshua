**Too far gone.** The scariest task we can undertake in this life is to peel back the layers of the persona we’ve carefully put together for ourselves and be simply who we are. Even scarier still, allowing a perfect God to see that person. However, in this day of privacy settings and social media, we’ve gotten so used to manipulating the information available about ourselves that we begin to do this very same PR work with God as well. While you may fool some people for a while, God is not fooled for an instant.

> “‘Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, and before you were born I consecrated you; I appointed you a prophet to the nations.’” — Jeremiah 1:5

> “For you formed my inward parts; you knitted me together in my mother’s womb.” — Psalm 139:13

**God made you.** Before the creation of the earth, He created you and knew every inch of you inside and out. If He knew you before time, then how much could you surprise Him with now? Don’t deceive yourself, you are no mystery before God. However, just as you were loved then, you are loved now.

> “‘Can a man hide himself in secret places so that I cannot see him? declares the LORD. Do I not fill heaven and earth? declares the LORD.’” Jeremiah 23:24

**God is everywhere.** There isn’t a thing you have done or can do that God Himself did not witness. Nothing you can do can take that less than sterling remark or event off your timeline. No, He’s been there through it all. He’s seen everything. He hasn’t been idle, either. Throughout each twist and turn of life, He’s been trying to subtly let you know He’s there.

> “And the son said to him, ‘Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son.’ But the father said to his servants, ‘Bring quickly the best robe, and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet. And bring the fattened calf and kill it, and let us eat and celebrate. For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found.’ And they began to celebrate.” — Luke 15:21–24

**He’s waiting with open arms.** Everything that we try to hide from others, all that we find unsavory and unlovable is not so to God. He is waiting for us expectantly to turn around and see His outstretched arms. He is openly inviting us back into His presence. He’s offering us a feast, the magnitude of which has never been seen before.

What is it you’ve done that cannot be forgiven? Where have you gone that you can’t return? There are no deeds too foul and no place too far. You are loved by a God who gave everything He had for you and wants to keep giving you more. So you’ve run, you’ve sinned, you don’t know how to say sorry. This isn’t about you. None of this is about you, but in fact it’s about Him, who _He_ is and what _He_’s done. Who else has done this for you? How many could endure such hardship in relationship and still welcome you with open arms? Won’t you simply fall into them today? No one is _too far gone_.
