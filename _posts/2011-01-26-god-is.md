I finished reading Knowledge of the Holy by A.W. Tozer, culminating a months long process (yes, I’m a painfully slow reader) just the other day. If you haven’t read it or even heard of it, I would highly recommend it. For the average reader, it’s a quick and painless but very powerful read focused on what we can and should know about God. I say all this so I can now say that this is wholly inspired by this book. This post is meant to both be a gross under/overstatement based on the contents of this book.

What I am wholeheartedly convinced of is that God, the supreme being of the universe, is _infinitely greater_ than anyone could ever imagine or comprehend. Now, think about that…
