It’s once again been a few days since I’ve posted, but to be honest I’m torn as to what I want to share with you today. It’s been an interesting week, honestly. The high note has certainly been the restoration of my driving privileges (but I’ll share more on that in the next couple days). Yes, I’m finally done coping with the immediate consequences of the DUI I got last year. Today, I want to share with you the struggle I’ve felt this week with consumerism, especially in anticipation of the holiday, or should I say _shopping_, season.

#### Coming down with consumerism fever

People who know me well are very aware that I don’t step foot in brick and mortar stores unless I’m buying groceries (or going to Costco, but that’s horse of another color). My family knows that I may not be the king of online shopping, but I could certainly make a career of it. What most people don’t know is that I definitely am suffering this week from what I’ll lovingly call consumerism fever. What’s got me sick? Sadly, a Macbook Pro. \*Gasp\* No, I’m not an Apple fanboy, but I’m a techie and I’m a nerd, moreover I’m both without a laptop. This is increasingly not a good situation, friends. But I obsess over getting this piece of silicon and metal and getting the best deal for it when and if (OK, _when_) I do. It’s rather depressing that my life has devolved to this point. Even to me.

#### What consumerism is keeping me from

What if I had an ounce of this obsession, this compulsion, for God? What if I were to bottle this desire for consumerism and seek to “consume” God’s love and grace with even just a small portion of that desire? I don’t. And it’s this fact that makes this week rather depressing to me. Look at what I’m doling out my time and affection on and what it’s replacing. See the worthlessness of a computer compared to a Father. When I put it into that light, my silly little desire no longer seems harmless and trivial. No, it tears away my heart from the Love which it knew first. My consumerism, my selfishness and greed, blinds me from seeing what I _need_, that which is good and true. I’m trying to split time worshipping at the feet of two thrones, but really I’m neglecting the important one.

Where do you find your heart’s affections this bleak (it is here) Wednesday? On the eve (now that stores open tomorrow evening) of the biggest shopping day of the year, do you find yourself buying into the consumerism that is so ubiquitous in today’s society? Before we get caught up in the new “spirit” of the season, let’s take a step back and reevaluate. Instead of buying _stuff_, let’s buy ourselves a little more time with God, a little more time with our Father. Let’s trade the money and time spent shopping on valuable experiences with friends, family, and loved ones. Let us consume grace and love. Happy Thanksgiving, friends.
