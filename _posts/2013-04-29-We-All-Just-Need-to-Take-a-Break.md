So, friend, how’s your Monday going? Did you have a good weekend? I’ll bet you could use a break right about now. I’ll also go so far as to assume that while your weekend was good, it hasn’t refreshed you for today like you thought it might. Then again, maybe I’m wrong. Maybe you’re hitting your stride for the afternoon and a break is the last thing your productivity needs. That may be true, but I’ll be willing to bet that you, like me, could use some true rest that not only allowed you to catch up on your sleep, but also refreshed your soul.

#### Why don’t you allow yourself a break?

I’d imagine the idea of a break sounds lovely to you, but there’s just not enough time. A respite would be wonderful, but what about the kids, the clients, project, you name it? There is always something holding us back. There’s always someone, some_thing_ telling us that we have external responsibilities that trump our need to get rest. The rest of the world is relying on us never taking a break, because we’ll only miss out on that one opportunity or we’ll let down the wrong person. Ask yourself, “Is that true?”

> “Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.” — Matthew 11:28–30

Maybe I’m making up a problem that isn’t real. Maybe I’m putting too much emphasis on these words. Maybe I’m the one who needs a break because I don’t understand His words. I certainly wouldn’t argue with the latter point. However, I know there has to be a reason why this country is filled with people who spend the most time at work, but are no happier for it. I know that while we take lavish vacations to exotic places, have the best weekends going out with our friends, most of us come into the week limping because we’re still not rested. So, I turn to you. Do you need a break? If you do, to where will you turn for that break?
