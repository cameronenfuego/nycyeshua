So, I love the Fray. Their new album took a little while to grow on me, but it certainly has. My favorite song without doubt, well, I love at least 3/4 of the album but my favorite is “Absolute”. Just listen to the song and think about the lyrics and I dare you not to like it. Ok, so I can’t really say that, but I really do like it.  
Yes, music pretty much surrounds about everything in my life. So, my group won the competition with our robot, which was hugely satisfying. It made the time and energy spent a little more worthwhile.  
There’s so much that I want to talk about right now, but I don’t have a lot of time given the fact that I have to leave for bible study in a few, but I will try to make this quick. There’s a lot of anger that I harbor toward God, I realized from going through the prep for my bible study. It went along nicely with the message from last night. Things that I thought were long in the past, are only in the past as far as people are concerned. However, I still hold God responsible for letting these things happen. It’s not the way I would have done things and I think that somehow my way would have been better. I’m not willing to get over my pride and admit that I am not God and I will not understand His ways as they’re far above and beyond my own. There will be trouble in this world, but what I don’t see and understand is that this trouble is to have its perfect and desired result. God doesn’t cause calamity, because it is not His way to harm us, but He does allow us to be stretched in different ways that He might be glorified. The fact that He can use me at all in His big plan is completely overwhelming. How He can use something as tainted and broken as me, I don’t understand. The beautiful thing is that I don’t have to and I can let my fear and anxiety go and just give my past, present and future over to one who is far beyond my own mental, physical and all other abilities. Thank God =)
