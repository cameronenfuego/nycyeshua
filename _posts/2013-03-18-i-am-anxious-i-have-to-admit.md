So, I’ve been house searching for several weeks now. I say several because it’s been over a month and it feels like an eternity. At this point, it’s beginning to feel like I may not find a place. Yes, I’m pretty anxious at this point.

> Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and do not lean on your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge Him, and He will make straight your paths. — Proverbs 3:5–6

#### Anxious by any other name

I heard this passage in church yesterday morning and I had to pause. That’s right. I don’t have to do this all on my own. The fate of the world, as I’ve come to reason, does _not_ rest on my shoulders (yes, I’m overly dramatic). He will, as I submit my anxious fears, make my paths straight. But the road isn’t getting any easier.

#### Make straight my paths

What are straight paths? They, first and foremost, are not smooth. They are just as rocky and treacherous as before. Straight refers to orientation. The path will no longer be so meandering. God will get you there and He will do so along a straight line. He will iron out the wrinkles in the road. Life _will_ get easier. But, to a degree.

#### Where the rubber meets the road

The words “and do not lean on your own understanding” get me every time. Do I abandon reason? Do I throw my hands up in the air and sit, waiting for God to move me? No. These words are a part of the imperative statement. They emphasize trusting in God. They add focus to the fact that trust is absolute. Anxious or not, God will take care of me. God will not let me down. God will not let Himself down. He has promised to be there for His children. God, the Unchanging One, swore this oath upon Himself. To break it would be to go against the very core of who He is. I may be anxious, but He is infinitely faithful.

Though it seems God is dragging His feet, often it’s because we are dragging ours. I’ve become anxious in my search, therefore I’ve pulled away from my Father, thinking He will let me down like any other person is apt to do. Only, He will not. He has never. And He never will. End of story. So, I wait and I pray. But I act. Prayerfully. Friend, what is making you anxious today? Have you drawn back from your Father like me and tried to carry the burden on your own? There’s another option.
