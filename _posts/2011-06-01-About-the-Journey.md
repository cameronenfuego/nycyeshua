**Never, ever forget these words:**

> “Enjoy the journey and those traveling with you, not just the destination.” — Phil Carnuccio

This is a lesson I’ve been learning in earnest for the past few months since reading _A Million Miles in a Thousand Years_ by Donald Miller. It was the focal point of a message I heard this past Sunday at Providence Church here in West Chester. Then, you look at [Stuff Christians Like](http://www.jonacuff.com/stuffchristianslike/2011/06/have-no-clue-how-god-will-use-your-story/) today. There is no doubt God wants my heart in this area.

It was especially timely given the fact that I am ending one story that is my internship and jumping off a cliff into another. Honestly, I do not know what this next story looks like in particular, but this blog and my music (in which I dabble) are a part. However, I will not make this journey if I do not have the right support. Looking back at this past year as a supported (getting donations) intern, it is undeniable that life as a whole cannot be survived alone, as it was never meant to be.

> “Then God said, “Let us make man in our image, after our likeness.” — Genesis 1:26a

There is no mistaking the fact that this is a trinitarian God creating man in His (at the same time _Their_ pluralistic) image. Not to perform a full exegesis here, but it would be preposterous for the author to include the “our” in the verse were it not to intonate a need for others, for _community_. For those of you who’ve been following along, I may be beating a dead horse, but I do not see how with something so intrinsic and crucial this can be done.

The symbol of the first church was their deep sense of and need for _community_. The apostles were never scattered until they all went into hiding after the crucifixion. In our times of need, we seek people, not exclusion. I could go on, but that would be redundant.

As I face the precipice of a new journey, I am thrilled and terrified all at once. I do not know the path, nor do I know the destination. All I know is my next step and that God has graciously given me some of the most amazing people to support me along the way when I fall down or stray from my path. _This is life_. I’m already taken care of and the fear begins to fade.

Dear friend, what is your story? Are you living it _actively_ or postponing it daily? Worse yet, are you going it _alone_? Again, I repeat the call.

**“Enjoy the journey and those traveling with you, not just the destination.”**  
And never forget to thank God for those fellow sojourners. The road is _long_ and _narrow_. They are a pure gift from above. _Don’t let them forget that either_.
