Well, I didn’t realize until just now that I haven’t posted in about a week and a half. This is a sure sign of my semester getting a little busier. I just don’t have time to post every day. I wish I could post more often, but such is life.  
I’ve spent the last couple days studying for intro philosophy and it’s been driving me nuts. I realize that I’m hell-bent on making the world black and white. The lack of absolute conclusions in the readings have really been getting to me and it took me until just now to understand that it’s because of this inability to accept gray areas. Life is much simpler with two choices rather than veritably infinite. Let’s face it, there is almost nothing that is absolute in this world. That’s just the way it is. However, I do believe there to be an absolute set of base morals and what makes the rest gray is each individual’s application of these absolute morals to various situations. This doesn’t sound terribly earth shattering, I know it’s not, but coming from someone in such great denial of the color gray in decisions, this is a bit of a stretch for me.  
I wish I had a little more to say, maybe something of a little more…substance, I guess, but I’m tapping out right now.
