            <p>It’s odd to admit that my greatest fear has to do with relationships given what I do professionally. I feel both a fraud and vulnerable to say that I’m scared to acknowledge that I’m terribly afraid of hurting people which leads to them abandoning me—confirming that I am indeed unworthy of love and relationship at all.

Romantically speaking, I can say with confidence that most of my exes see me as the former. I can be whatever you prefer; yet, this has very little to do with the proverbial you I believe.</p>

<p>We had thunderstorms roll through this afternoon as a cold front swooped in like a blustery blanket accompanied with sheets of rain. I made an event of it, turning out the lights, opening the shades, and planting myself in front of the kitchen window. It didn’t always use to be this way.</p>

<p>Working in mental health is a pretty thankless career path, and I’m grateful for that fact. Working in substance use within the field, as I see firsthand, is a particular kind of thanklessness. But I have chosen it to help circumvent the savior complex so many therapists encounter at one point or another.</p>

As hard as it was to break up with the old church, my community, marriage, and former life, God was the hardest to leave behind—that’s why it took me more than three years when all the others had been a matter of months. I will warn you that this post might be particularly triggering for many.</p>

<p>I feel a tremendous weight has been placed on the past few days, the first days since the constant calamity of 2020. I have certainly felt more hopeful and ready for a new year than perhaps ever, but I see that this expectation is not without weight. That weight, I’ve realized, has given my inner critic more input than is typical—especially since I have made that the focus of a fair amount of my work.</p>

<p>Over a month-and-a-half ago, I confronted the idea that evangelicalism—all of it—is an abusive system. In therapy, I found out that the revelation is still fucking with the internal dissonance that I’ve called equilibrium the past three years. However, I’m grateful for this insight.</p>

<p>I’m struggling to put together the words to describe where I find myself as I sit down before this blank screen. This haziness, or fuzziness, is why I want to continue as it feels truer than merely a narcissistic indulgence. I wonder if we’re all not in a certain grey space? We are weary from a year that has held no punches, saddened by 9/11-every-day death rates, disgust for a government standing by idly, excited for a holiday with a limited friend group or family members, and the rebellious hope of a better new year.</p>

<p>I will do my best to attempt to tie together these tenuous threads on which I’ve been noodling the past week. I’ve spent a lot of time in these last few days thinking of the ways I abandon myself and look for external resources or solutions for perceived problems in my inner world. It’s been a particularly turbulent time of introspection—right on time for my annual introspective deep dive.</p>

<p>I’ll first start by explaining this title to you. My favorite band on earth is Green Day. This should not be a surprise to many—if any—of you. Their album “American Idiot” was very formative for me, but my brother had presciently exposed me to them shortly after “Dookie” had been released, so don’t you dare label me a bandwagoner.</p>

<p>It’s not lost on me as I reflect on another year, my thirty-third trip around our sun, looking, as I like to joke, something akin to white Jesus. This birthday carries with it a special significance; as others have noted before, it’s the “Jesus” birthday—Jesus was crucified at the age of thirty-three for those of you lost in the allegory. A person I deeply appreciate and respect encouraged me in our time together this morning to—continuing a theme I have observed over the past couple of months—grieve and mourn. Still, this time it was to grieve the loss of the God I once knew. So this is a post of lament for the God who died and was buried some three years ago; it’s finally time to stop running and acknowledge the loss.</p>

<p>In this eternal year that mostly feels like living through the movie <em>Groundhog Day</em>, according to the calendar, yesterday was September 11.

<p>One of the first lessons I learned when I worked in marketing was how much people love getting free things. Regardless of the product or service, give people something for free. Especially in selling business to business (B2B), offering the customer a month of free service—where they invested time in setting up our service and customizing it to their liking—felt like a dirty trick.</p>

<p>I’ve been interested in trauma since I first heard about it a few years ago. Frankly, the more I understand about trauma—especially since I just started looking into <a href="https://www.resmaa.com/">Resmaa Menakem’s white-body supremacy trauma</a>—I wonder if it isn’t the most human of experiences and our primary emotion if you will, especially when we look at trauma from an epigenetic standpoint.</p>

<p>I have a complicated relationship with the divine. It’s been more profoundly complicated for nearly the past four years. However, the relationship probably started out as more complex since I became aware that there was a divine, notably at the age of five, when I accepted Jesus into my heart. The relationship was never stable or static from the start. I shouldn’t be surprised that I refer to the divine as Mystery today.</p>

<p>I had tried to write something else, but after getting a few words on the screen, I realized that I had something else to talk about. I have to admit that being in therapy today—while needed—is far more challenging than at any other time in my life. And I’ve been in therapy for about four years in aggregate.</p>

<p>It’s been more days since my last post than I had planned—well, initially. However, the past few days have been intentional as I realized that I needed to spend more time listening, learning, marinating. The past couple of weeks have been dizzying. Simultaneously, too much has happened and yet woefully too little.</p>

<p>Over the past few days, the need to rebel and revolt against the old “normal” became inescapable to me, and much of White America. Black people and People of Color have been dying for this painful reality for hundreds of years already. For those of us at variable stages of wokeness, we were jolted from our comfortable slumber abruptly. If you’re anything like me, the naked rage that has coursed through my veins is uncomfortable, to say the least.</p>

<p>I can’t tell y’all the number of posts I’ve written in my head in the past week, and none of them felt right. I’ve felt a few little but significant enough shifts within me in the last week or so, and I feel those shifts have been a bit emblematic of what’s going on in a meta-sense. I wonder if a few of y’all aren’t a bit confused—as I find myself—in what to think and how to feel right now. I don’t promise much about this update other than the fact that it will be a form of a streaming-consciousness grab bag.</p>

<p>I feel like I—and we—are in the liminal space between a death and a rebirth. Societally, I think we are on the precipice of breaking into a new sense of inclusion and equality. Yes, this is a more optimistic view. I recognize we are also on the ledge, liable of falling into the canyon of ever-greater income inequality.</p>

<p>While some states are beginning the process of opening up, you have news of large corporations extending work from home policies into the fall. The juxtaposition is a bit dizzying. Really, I just don’t want to be talking about the subject of this damn pandemic anymore.</p>

<p>I’m not sure what was more jarring, taking work home with us every day or bringing the home into the workplace—and the lack of choice the pandemic ushered in on both accounts with such abruptness. Seemingly overnight, everyone <em>had *to work from home. Every day, we couldn’t *not</em> bring home work; every day, we brought our homes straight to the little makeshift workplace that many were forced to carve out with little prep time.</p>

<p>What world will we create in moving forward? This is the question on the top of my mind and has been for weeks now. I’d also love to know when we’ll be able to move freely about and create that world more tangibly. However, we will continue physical distancing to protect those most vulnerable and ourselves alike. In this time, I am reminded that I and we are recreating today a new future. One that we will soon enough be able to physically step into if you will.</p>

<p>This post comes from a delicate place as I think we are all—to put it mildly—feeling like ass cheeks rubbed raw by sandpaper. Maybe it really is all too much, this pandemic, the abrupt loss of so much, forced distance from friends and loved ones, death, and the overnight vanishing of a past life—at least our old <em>way</em> of life. Maybe, just maybe, it is all too much. In the past few days, I have been struck by my own muchness. I wonder if a few others, perhaps many or all of you, haven’t been sensing that their individual reservoirs are deeper and more voluminous than previously thought?</p>

<p>I’m not sure who of you can relate to a sense of deep self-doubt. Like a crippling sort of doubt that convinces you that what you have to contribute is unoriginal, worthless, and devoid of meaning—all before you’ve even started.

<p>Who am I? It’s one of the earliest questions—or maybe <em>the</em> earliest question—we ask in life. It’s also the question that we will continue to ask, answer, and reanswer. Our earliest answer is one that is much more <em>given</em> to us than something we find for ourselves.

<p>Pensive does not begin to approach adequately describing the level of introspection I feel like I’ve experienced the past few weeks. As I was explaining yesterday, I feel the rhythm of the calendar leads me to spending more time in a reflective state with a birthday in November—the ending of a year of existence—that dovetails into the introspection that typically accompanies the ending of another calendar year. This year proved no different.</p>

<p>I’ll admit, it’s so much easier to live life based on the principle of either-or. Something is one or the other, black or white. There are two categories for everything; gray can be exhausting. I cannot argue that a color with infinite shades isn’t exhausting.

<p>I’m going to try and relate to you what may have been the worst Thanksgiving I’ve ever had. However, there will be a silver lining to this story. Eventually. It was a pretty rough day.</p>

<p>It’s been too many days since my last post. But that only goes to show how scared I am to venture into these depths on my own, let alone to share with you a glimpse of my darkness. It’s tough as an Enneagram type 2 to dive into these murky waters, because I want to tell myself they do not exist, that the ocean of shame and fear is a mirage and that my drowning in them is a figment of the imagination. But the term scarcity really begins to explain some of what I find down there.</p>

<p>It’s called scarcity, but I didn’t know that as a child. I only knew that I was supposed to act a certain way, that I was supposed to achieve a certain amount — I was never sure what that magical amount was. There was a definition that my parents had articulated in part of perfection, of enough, that I was constantly chasing. Except, I never stopped, never questioned, and here I am. All I have is “not enough”; there is never <em>enough; I am not enough</em>.</p>

<p>If you’ve been following me at all on social media, you’ve probably noticed my use of the words “life as liturgy.” Honestly, I am certain I’ve shoehorned those words into posts more often than not, but I hope you’re able to look past my shortcoming there. I feel like it’s about time to explain what I mean by those words as I attempt to dedicate this next year (and maybe more years to come) of my life to them.</p>

<p>It feels like I should be closing out this second decade of my life with something meaningful, but I feel as if I’m falling short these days. What I mean is, I feel like there’s something I should be doing to commemorate the death of my twenties, like there’s some appropriate memorialization, a rite of passage, of which I’m not aware. But this idea of the need for a perfect sendoff is the remnant of learning so long ago that I needed to be someone else — someone other than who I am naturally — to survive this life. And maybe this gradual unlearning of things as I’m exploring in this series of posts is precisely the commemoration my twenties deserve, <em>need</em>.</p>

<p>I’ll confess, the prospect of imperfection after years of the need to be perfect is not in the least enticing. It’s hard pretending that I want to be anything less than perfect most all of the time. As I said, I learned at a young age that perfection was required for love, safety, and survival. However, perfection isn’t real; I don’t want to be real, I want to survive; please don’t let my humanity show. I think this reflects too much of my prayer life.</p>

<p>I’m not sure when I first learned it, but I figured it out pretty early in life that to receive love, attention, affirmation, protection, and sustenance, I needed to be perfect. Looking back, I’m honestly in awe of how observant and sponge-like God made children. That’s a hell of a correlation for an infant or a toddler to make. That’s one <em>hell</em> of a correlation.</p>

<p>I would like to say that I booked my flight to Paris for a good reason, but I would be lying. I knew I just needed to get away. I needed space from the prison that used to be a home, somewhere to be when she was posting photos from the trip that was to be a celebration of our anniversary. I’m not on that on that trip; I was asked not to come; it’s not our celebration anymore.</p>

<p>I played a few holes of golf with my dad yesterday. There was a group playing behind us, so we were hurrying — I should say, my dad was trying to hurry us. Thus, I was being hurried. You don’t hurry someone who’s never played golf before. I was feeling the pressure and getting frazzled. I was failing. I was nearing the verge of giving up completely.</p>

<p>I was on the way to the airport to spend a few days with my dad. I stopped by the house to drop off a few items of clothing that were worn and served no purpose in the warm Florida summer sun, and to pick up a few others. I lost track of how many times I told my dog George I was sorry. I couldn’t verbalize for what—it took everything within me to not break down into a puddle and to be ready when the Lyft was scheduled to arrive–but for so many things. Poor puppy.</p>

<p>Hello again, friends. It’s been over 10 months since my last post, but this election has me thinking thoughts I feel I need to return here to process before I burst. Perhaps I feel like I’m going crazy, but at least I know I’m not going crazy alone. This has been a long and ugly campaign season. We’ve endured months on end of some of the meanest and most personal attacking tactics I can recall — not that I’ve been paying attention to too many in my still-short life.</p>

If you had been following along with this blog for any period of time, I apologize for my sudden and prolonged disappearance. I needed a little time away.

<p>Aw, screw it. You know, I had something for this. I had a post written in my head, but somehow it just doesn’t seem to matter much at the moment. Maybe I should just stop here and send this draft to the trash. That’s how a lot of ideas in my life die an untimely death. Creativity withers away before it can blossom like a flower bud met by a late-season frost. I’m too afraid to breathe a little life into the idea and let it take shape before I judge it. Instead, I allow the imaginary critic in my mind convince me up one cranial wall and down the other of why it’s a terrible idea and why it should never see the light of day. And the idea doesn’t.</p>

<p>I’ve had my glasses less than a year, so I still occasionally get compliments about them and I don’t mind them much yet. But for someone who can be OCD, glasses are a terrible thing; how does anyone keep the lenses clean for even an hour?! Mainly I have them for driving, but I’ll bring my glasses along anytime I might have a meeting or presentation or any other situation where distance focus might be advantageous. Heaven forbid there are spots on the lenses, because not only will they drive me nuts if I don’t have a cloth to clean them off, but practically, they’re obscuring my vision — the very thing they are supposed to be correcting. I feel like this spotting and smudging often happens with my faith.</p>

And while that’s a silly example, I think it has a lot to do with this idea of <a href="http://104.193.143.57/~waywar13/ce/curious-case-busyness/" title="The Curious Case of Busyness">busyness</a> I’ve been ruminating on the past few weeks.</p>

<p>I wish I had a conclusion to this post, but I’m really just jotting down some thoughts on the idea of busyness as a means of putting those thoughts to paper (screen, but whatever). I’m also trying to bounce those thoughts off you, so if you have some feedback, I’d love to hear it. But busyness is a curious thing, said the man too “busy” to blog regularly. What really <em>is</em> busyness? Is it a fate inevitable in the current age? Is it a side effect of a life being squeezed of every last drop of enjoyment and effectiveness like the juice of a ripe orange? Or could it be the opposite? Okay, I think it’s two things: a distraction filled lifestyle and an unwillingness to focus, borne of the fear of missing out.</p>

<p>Truth be told, I’ve written this post over 20 times in the past couple months. Returning to this blog has been monumentally daunting. As the days passed, the idea of returning and what I should say have been blowing in like a Midwestern summer storm. Thick clouds of doubt and trepidation have kept me from updating the many times. But I can’t sleep. I want to, but I physically lack the ability to go to bed tonight; it’s long past time that I blogged. I want to write about how great marriage is and how much I’ve learned recently, but my heart is too heavy to convey such lofty thoughts. No, tonight is about the weight of the past few days. Tonight is about hate, evil, and how they relate to my alma mater and a place called Ferguson.</p>

<p>There are many things that can seem to bring us shame in this life. We are fragile souls treading lightly across an unforgiving and often harsh earth, so it should be no surprise that we all at some point experience shame for something we for one reason or another believe should bring us to the harsher hell that is shame. Today, I’m going to let you in to view one event that brought me nearly fifteen years of it. I will warn you, friend, it is not the feeble shame of a white lie once told to protect the feelings of a friend, but shame from something far more damaging, more sinister. So please, if you would like to stop reading, I encourage you do so now, my feelings are unhurt.</p>

<p>I don’t know where to begin, as it’s been…too long. So, like any good writer, I’ll start in the middle. I’ve been struggling to put words to paper (screen) for over two months, because I’ve been unwilling to let go of the altruistic, but ultimately fake ideal that this blog isn’t for me or about me, and since I had nothing really uplifting to say, I said nothing. And it’s in that quiet, tension-filled djinn I’ve languished the past couple months. So, I’m sorry reader, this blog is not about you, but I sincerely hope you enjoy the ride. Otherwise, please feel free to stop reading here. Don’t worry, my feelings won’t be hurt in the least.</p>

<p>Something that was drilled into my head at a relatively early age were the words “life isn’t fair.” I didn’t really understand what that meant, but since then I’ve been very careful not to mix fair with life or its circumstances. However, what’s a boy to do when a girl flits into his life (my girlfriend of four months who up until now I have treated largely as a yeti) speaking things of fairness in conversations, situations, and disagreements? You see, this boy has been beckoned to reevaluate his stance on fairness and learn how to fight fair, while it’s true that life is far from fair. Allow me to elaborate.</p>

<p>It’s been a really long time since I last posted, I’m sorry. In all honesty, life’s gotten busy and I haven’t managed my priorities well. But enough about me and onto Jesus. There’s been a lot of talk in the Church over the concern about what I will call the “millennial exodus.” Millennials have been leaving the Church en masse, and few people seem to have a clue what to do about it. I’m not saying I do, but I’d like to offer some conjecture as to why Jesus is problematic to my age demographic.</p>

<p>It’s been a really long time since I last blogged. Forgive me, friends. I’d completely intended to post after spending a morning reading through the words above “for His steadfast love endures forever,” <em>twenty-six</em> times throughout <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalm+136&amp;version=ESV">Psalm 136</a>. For perspective, there are only twenty-six verses in the psalm. A few days later, I come across Psalm 138, which references this very same phrase. God is trying to tell me something. God is trying to tell us all something about His love.</p>

<p>While having a conversation the other day, I was asked the question, “Is a marketer successful if their efforts don’t result in sales?” “No,” I answered instantly, startling myself with my certainty. I gathered my thoughts and explained how the purpose of a business is to make money, and if a business isn’t selling, they aren’t making money, and they are out of business. The marketer ceases to be. And then I realized that analogy is somewhat applicable to our lives and how we share the Gospel. Except, God is the business in the analogy and the purpose of the “business” is to bring glory to God. If we really care about and love God, then we’ll talk about God, show Him to the world around us. We will be marketing God, but not to keep our jobs. We will find ways to be Jesus to the world, because our love will compel us to do so.</p>

This brings me to my own, which is busyness, and I’m sorry to those faithful of you who haven’t seen anything new in over a week.

At least that’s where I’ve found myself, but I feel a strange peace because though on the surface I’m praying that “bad” things happen, I know that ultimately I am praying for God to use these circumstances to bring about a greater good.</p>

Visiting the church this past weekend, I realized that these times of feeling forsaken, abandoned, are just what we need from time to time. It’s the moments when we feel God is giving us nothing that we are given a choice. Do we pursue God Himself, though we’re getting nothing from Him at the moment, do we love Him for who He is and not His gifts, or do we run?</p>

            <p>So, it’s been three weeks since I pulled my back. Therefore, for one who treats most things as if they have an on-off switch, it’s been three weeks of moderate torture. I’ve always been fortunate enough to physically do just about whatever I wanted, so silly injuries like this immediately turn into mountain-out-of-a-molehill type situations. However, I got back to the gym this week, but it was far from an enjoyable experience. It hit me last night that my trip to the gym was not all that unlike bringing ourselves before God, whether for the first time or the millionth. Bringing ourselves before God requires humility, submitting to our Father’s authority, admitting we <em>are</em> not and can <em>never</em> be equal to Him.</p>

            <p>So, it’s fitting that I’d be sitting here typing this post on New Year’s Eve with a strained back. No, I’m not going for self-deprecation or even some take on karma. The past few weeks have been a noted time of breaking down for me. But up until this past weekend, it was more of an emotional breaking down. I suppose God felt it was time to further the process. And it wasn’t until yesterday that I had any clue why. Because of that, I can honestly tell you I’m grateful for where I sit right now. But how can one be grateful for being broken?</p>

<h4 id="the-joy-in-beingbroken">The joy in being broken</h4>

<p>The joy of the believer lies not in the surroundings or the current state of being, but in the perpetual being of God. What is this supposed to mean? That’s a great question, friend. It means that God only allows us to be broken because of how good He is. It may not make sense today, but God stoops to our depths to allow us to endure pain just so He can show us truly how bright is the Light. He loves us so much that He will show us the kind of tough love that we need most in the moment. I wish you could understand this to be as beautiful as I see it right now. Because in the moment of pain and despair, He lifts our beleaguered head and gives us sips of grace. No, the pain is but fleeting, the broken parts of us will be mended momentarily.</p>

<h4 id="god-of-thebroken">God of the broken</h4>

<p>A quick glance over the lineage of Jesus will show that He came from a family tree sprinkled with persons from every walk of life. From prostitutes to priest kings, criminals to those after God’s heart, Jesus can claim all relatives. What this means to us today is that Jesus grew up hearing stories of broken people, calling them His ancestors. Jesus lived a life nothing short of being completely broken to the will of God. However, you never once see Him complain about being broken. Au contraire, you see Him rejoice and call others to the same. Jesus understood intrinsically that being broken was the only way to be made whole. He knew that broken was only broken in name, nothing more. And so we rejoice as He rejoiced.</p>

<h4 id="the-rejoicing-of-thebroken">The rejoicing of the broken</h4>

<p>As another year draws to a close, I encourage you friend to take stock of the past 365 days. Where have you seen victory? Where have you felt failure? In those failures, where have you felt most pricked, angry, frustrated? Now, stay with that feeling. Delve deeper; follow the rabbit trail. I’ll be willing to bet that along the path, there lies at least one way in which God is waiting for you to offer up yourself to be gently broken. Don’t be afraid. He is good. God is gentle. God is loving. God is the God of the broken. So rejoice with me into the new year, friend. Rejoice.</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p>I hope everyone had a good Christmas. Actually, I hope everyone had a phenomenal Christmas unlike any before it. How was your Christmas, though? If I had to pick one word to summarize mine, it’d have to be “busy.” Yes, I had a busy Christmas, and that Christmas could’ve been better. It wasn’t bad, but the fact that it could have been better is my fault. Let me tell you why.</p>

<h4 id="the-root-of-the-busy-christmas">The root of the busy Christmas</h4>

<p>What causes a busy Christmas is a heart in chaos. What brings forth disorder in the world is disorder within. And disheveled, out of touch with myself was how I began this season. Tired, weary, overdrawn, and unkempt is how I would describe myself the week before Thanksgiving. The holiday season never helps such a person, and it was no different for me. To boil it down, I hadn’t been prioritizing my time with God. I was tired, so I wouldn’t get up as early as I needed, thus things got cut out of the morning routine, and the first to go was the time where God’s word centers me before the winds of care blow me to and fro the rest of the day. And a dry well without rain can merely stay dry.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Praise the Lord, all nations! Extol Him, all peoples! For great is His steadfast love toward us, and the faithfulness of the Lord endures forever. Praise the Lord! — Psalm 117</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="the-cure-for-the-busy-christmas">The cure for the busy Christmas</h4>

<p>I read this Psalm this morning and it caught me off guard. It’s so…short! The entire Psalm is but two verses, four sentences. But, the words that are there say everything. Within them are the crux of Christmas. They are the peace amidst a busy Christmas. They are life. This should be our lifesong. This should be the light we shine into the world. Praise the Lord! Do you know how much He loves you? Do you know He’s always loved you and always will love you? If you’re anything like me, though, friend I’ll bet you don’t. I’ll bet you have no clue. If you or I did, I promise it would completely wreck our current worldviews. It would forever change our lives. It would forever change the lives of those around us.</p>

<p>For many, the holiday season crescendos at a busy Christmas. For many, especially myself, it’s a frenzied marathon highlighted by the sprint into Christmas Day. Where is there rest? Where is there life and joy? It is found in understanding and embracing the love and faithfulness of our God. It’s realizing that love and faithfulness was embodied on Christmas Day in the birth of Jesus. It’s knowing in the deepest crevices of our hearts that it is still embodied today by our King and Savior. It’s living the resultant praise of a joyful and grateful heart that truly grasps the gift we were given two millennia ago, and everyday since.</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p>So at the risk of sounding like Scrooge, is there anyone else out there who finds the chaos of the season makes it a little more difficult to enjoy the holidays? Maybe? Well, for the one other out there, you know that once Thanksgiving is over, the month-or-so-long sprint begins where everyone in this country has to find all the best gifts for everyone at the lowest prices and will stop at (next to) nothing to achieve that goal. Common courtesies and driving laws all go out the window, along with the driving ability to boot. For once, this is not me being melodramatic, just sharing what’s racing around my brain the near two hours I spend on the road each day. However, in spite of it all, I find the fact that Jesus’ birth signified God loving us so much, that He came to physically be and experience with us. He loves us and wants to understand us so much, that He would become Emmanuel, God with us.</p>

<h4 id="god-with-us-in-themadness">God with us in the madness</h4>

<p>This season does carry with it a hint of madness, not all (or necessarily <em>most</em>) of it bad. The family get-togethers, the inherent quirkiness that is family and each member brings to the table, the work parties, the friendly get-togethers, yeah, it can get a little crazy especially when events begin overlapping as always seems to happen. You know, I think Jesus knows a lot about all this. I’m pretty sure He had the same scheduling conflicts, experienced the same craziness. What did He do? I’m not entirely sure, but I’m convinced that He made the most of every experience He could cram into His overflowing schedule. Why? Because people, living, loving, laughing, crying, simply <em>being</em> together is what it was all about for Him. And if we’re to take away anything from this season marking the Advent of God with us, it is that He wanted to be with us <em>all</em> the time. He still does.</p>

<h4 id="the-god-with-usall">The God with us all</h4>

<p>So it’s the last Friday before Christmas. I’m betting you have at least one or two more gatherings before Christmas day. I’m betting you’re either finishing up your Christmas gift buying (guilty), or wrapping up those little (or not so little) treasures. My challenge to you this blessed day is to do all this with joy. My challenge is to spread cheer and make those with whom you come into contact feel just a little more in the spirit of the season than before you happened upon their path. Friend, I think you can do it. Because this was the life of God with us, and this is the example I will try and emulate over the next few days.</p>

          <h2><a href="/advent-and-the-already-but-yet-to-come/">advent and the already but yet to come</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>Advent is an interesting word. Honestly, I wasn’t sure what it meant exactly until I looked it up. <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/advent?s=t">Dictionary.com</a> has the standard coming into being, Jesus, and holiday references, but then there’s a curious one at the bottom of the list. Advent also refers to the Second Coming. So, Advent is both the birth of Jesus <em>and</em> the Second Coming. Advent, Christmas, isn’t about a baby. This season, as I’m coming to understand is about the spectrum of Jesus’ birth, life, death, resurrection, and future return in glory. Wow, Christmas once again feels weighty and important.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But as [Joseph] considered these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, “Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take Mary as your wife, for that which is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. She will bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.” — Matthew 1:20–21</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="the-advent-of-thealready">The Advent of the already</h4>

<p>Advent began with the birth of Jesus in a way few of society’s poorest then and today have had to claim as their origins. Advent started with God descending to the level not just of kings and royalty, but to the level of everyman. He was born in this way that He might know the struggles and desires of every man, not being above or out of reach of anyone. He was born to know these struggles and burdens and put them to death once and for all. No, He did not make them disappear with a magic wand, but they no longer had to define our existence on this earth. He rose as a show of dominion over those struggles, our struggles. Advent was not just the birth of a man, but the birth of salvation that needed to be freed from its human cage.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I have said these things to you, that in me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation. But take heart; I have overcome the world.” — John 16:33</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="the-advent-of-the-yet-tocome">The Advent of the yet to come</h4>

<p>Advent culminates, with the quote above in the back of our minds, in the Second Coming of our Savior in full glory. Before He ascended the cross to be raised forever from the dead, our Savior declared His triumph, a victory in which we all share. He rose from the dead to make good on that claim, and He is patiently waiting to host the feast with us all for all eternity. Can you imagine that? What an awesome God we have, friend.</p>

<p>If like me you’ve had a tough year, try and think back to the real meaning for the season. It’s a time to look back, yes, but farther back than January 1. Look back to a stable two thousand years ago. Look back on salvation and the hope of joy and freedom. Then, look forward and see the awe-inspiring bliss and glorification of the Advent to come. It brings tears to my eyes as I type. Where is the drudgery and burden in this Advent? Advent is the removing of all that weighs us down. Advent is about God kneeling down to lift us up higher than our tiptoes can take us. Happy Advent, friends.</p>

          <h2><a href="/ice-skating-and-what-it-taught-me-about-life/">ice skating and what it taught me about life</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>I went ice skating this week with a few friends. It was a terrifying experience. I hate ice. Actually, I hate falling, and I’m well aware of the fact that falling on ice is about the most painful thing one can do. Seriously, my fear of falling on ice (has a lot to do with how I learned to skate) has to be unhealthy, but nonetheless it’s there. To answer your question, yes, of course I fell. However, somewhere in the process of trying to skate and talk at the same time, I found a sort of rhythm and lived to tell the tale (melodrama free of charge today). And in the day or so after, it struck me how much like life ice skating is.</p>

<h4 id="ice-skatingbasics">Ice skating basics</h4>

<p>Objective one (it’s a rule, if you ask me) is to stay on your feet. Doesn’t matter how fast you’re going. Doesn’t matter how pretty it looks. You want to maintain a perpendicular orientation to the ice. Objective two is to keep moving. Again, doesn’t matter how fast you’re going, as it’s more about your own comfort zone. One foot at a time, methodically propel yourself along this vast sheet of ice. Objective three is (rather plain, but needs be stated) to keep moving in the right direction. I have a hard enough time knowing there is a glassy sheet of ice waiting to pummel me at the first false move, I don’t need to add dodging humans into this potentially catastrophic situation. But seriously, you don’t need to be the one person skating around like an unguided rocket across the ice. No one likes that person. Can you tell it’s been a while since I last went ice skating?</p>

<h4 id="ice-skating-ridiculousness-aside">Ice skating ridiculousness aside</h4>

<p>Ice skating has a lot to do with life. Really, at the end of each day we’re taking stock of the fact that we’re still left standing. There are a lot of days where it feels ugly, uncoordinated, even as if we’re failing. Yes, we get knocked down, but standing is only an objective. The only difference is that when we fall in life, God is waiting with to pick us up, arms outstretched. Faith is about moving forward. Though at any point we may slip and fall, we continue putting one foot in front of the other. So we crash to the ice, we get back up and carry on. As we push on, we continually reorient ourselves toward the Father, navigating all the curves and obstacles. All the while, we trust that He is good, guiding us toward the end with a loving and caring heart, desiring to see us only succeed and grow.</p>

<p>Alright, so maybe ice skating wasn’t the scariest experience ever, but that’s something I can work on for next time. Faith, like ice skating, requires constantly adjusting to the slippery terrain underneath, the obstacles all around. This life is all about pressing onward toward the Father that is cheering each foot as it grazes the ice. He is encouraging every ounce of faith gained by His keeping us in safety and picking us up after each tumble. It’s scary and we don’t always know we’ll make it to the other side of the rink, but He is faithful. He is love and, though we feel in danger and out of control, that love will never fail us.</p>

          <h2><a href="/snow-day-in-the-adult-world/">snow day in the adult world</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>Today is a snow day here. Still working, but working from home. I’ve realized that a snow day like today is a catch-22 for most adults, a term which I now must begrudgingly apply to myself. After college (even in college), snow days no longer carry with them the luster they once used to. As an “adult”, the snow day just means more hassle, shoveling, planning, logistical problems. Snow days are just complicated.</p>

<h4 id="snow-daydrudgery">Snow day drudgery</h4>

<p>The snow day begins with waking up at the same time to make sure that it is indeed a snow day. Heaven forbid it isn’t, otherwise there is that great disappointment. Then, you have to make the executive decision as to how much longer (if at all) you’ll sleep in. Then, if you have kids, well, there are all those considerations. There are still the same myriad responsibilities and tasks that must get done. Email starts flying, phone calls, VPNs get fired up, and it’s just a digital mess. Oh, and most likely you’re stuck within the confines of your own four walls. All day.</p>

<h4 id="the-snow-daylost">The snow day lost</h4>

<p>We’ve lost the allure of the beautiful, awe-inspiring, pristine nature of a freshly fallen snow. Some of the most beautiful scenes I can remember involve a landscape gently resting under a freshly drawn blanket of snow. Even today, falling snowflakes stop me in my tracks, if only for a fleeting moment. The next second however, the mind races with all the necessary precautions and considerations that need to be made in an instant. But how much like the snowfall is God’s grace to us?</p>

<h4 id="fresh-as-the-early-snow-dayhours">Fresh as the early snow day hours</h4>

<p>The moment of excitement as you check outside the window first thing in the morning. It’s unlike many other moments. The moment when we see God’s grace as just that, undeserved gift. Precious are those moments. Yet, we let them go. We instantly get bogged down in the details. The minutiae get magnified within a moment. How important are those details, really? How much more important than the beauty at hand is what we feel we must immediately tend to? Silly heart of mine! It’s sad to have lost that childlike wonder. It’s a shame to have become so prematurely old. Father, forgive me.</p>

<p>Maybe it’s this snow day, maybe it’s the next, or some other blissful event, but take hold of it and just ruminate in it. Soak in the wonderment. Lap up the excitement, however childish it may seem. What we may not realize is that’s precisely why God’s given it. He wants us to enjoy it and be reminded of from where it came. He loves giving those little gifts. He wants to see us act “immature” and “childish” from time to time. Don’t be ashamed. Take care, friends.</p>

          <h2><a href="/prolonging-the-gratefulness/">prolonging the gratefulness</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>Gratefulness, gratitude, does not come easy to my heart. That’s what I realized last week. I always want more. Like the Israelites in the desert, the perennial whipping boy of faithlessness, I can always find something to complain about. Maybe I’m alone in this particular brokenness, but I find it extremely hard to hold on to a spirit of gratefulness. Many days I find it next to impossible to achieve anything more than sheer apathy. Given the current consumerist demands on and (more importantly) demands of my heart, I find it absolutely necessary to hold onto something else at least for a little longer. I received that gift of sorts a week ago now.</p>

<h4 id="gratefulness-of-a-newly-freedman">Gratefulness of a newly freed man</h4>

<p>Last Tuesday, I drove home from work without an interlock on my car (forcing me to take a breathalyzer to start my car and intermittently keep it running), or the status of restricted on my driver’s license. Last Tuesday marked the end of an over sixteen month road that began with a DUI, and ended unceremoniously with my ordering a replacement license that at long last lacked the alphabet soup of court codes I had hanging above me. I am certainly a marked man, but I am free. Sixteen months after the arrest, I am free, marked but free.</p>

<h4 id="gratefulness-for-theminute">Gratefulness for the minute</h4>

<p>I’ve never been so grateful to have to drive up through the mess of the Beltway and I-270 as I was this past weekend on the way to visit my mom’s parents. Even when I first got my license, this drive made that joy seem…simply less. Driving an interstate to a place that wasn’t work or a court-ordered appointment, knowing family would be there to greet me on the other end of my journey, was thrilling. It was not a terribly smooth drive. There was enough traffic and I was cut off a few times, but those facts didn’t and still don’t matter. See, I was so enthralled with being able to visit my family on my own, without needing anyone’s help (a ride), that even driving some of the DC area’s most notorious roads was a time of basking in God’s grace. Don’t worry, I’ll go check myself into the mental institution in just a moment.</p>

<p>Now that Cyber Monday’s come and gone and the holiday shopping season is in full swing, I know that I have a very distinct choice to make that will either make or break the next three-plus weeks. My choice, <em>our</em> choice, is do we choose gratefulness? Do we choose to strive after being content in what we’ve been given, what’s being given to us daily, or do we sellout for the electronics, the clothes, the menial <em>things</em> that will all too soon rust, wear out, or break? Or do we choose to find joy in driving along the heavily trafficked freeways of life, smiling amidst the congestion, being cut off, and the route not being as clear and straight as we would have hoped it might be? Today, everyday, we can choose gratefulness or complaint. What’ll it be, friend?</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p>It’s once again been a few days since I’ve posted, but to be honest I’m torn as to what I want to share with you today. It’s been an interesting week, honestly. The high note has certainly been the restoration of my driving privileges (but I’ll share more on that in the next couple days). Yes, I’m finally done coping with the immediate consequences of the DUI I got last year. Today, I want to share with you the struggle I’ve felt this week with consumerism, especially in anticipation of the holiday, or should I say <em>shopping</em>, season.</p>

<h4 id="coming-down-with-consumerism-fever">Coming down with consumerism fever</h4>

<p>People who know me well are very aware that I don’t step foot in brick and mortar stores unless I’m buying groceries (or going to Costco, but that’s horse of another color). My family knows that I may not be the king of online shopping, but I could certainly make a career of it. What most people don’t know is that I definitely am suffering this week from what I’ll lovingly call consumerism fever. What’s got me sick? Sadly, a Macbook Pro. *Gasp* No, I’m not an Apple fanboy, but I’m a techie and I’m a nerd, moreover I’m both without a laptop. This is increasingly not a good situation, friends. But I obsess over getting this piece of silicon and metal and getting the best deal for it when and if (OK, <em>when</em>) I do. It’s rather depressing that my life has devolved to this point. Even to me.</p>

<h4 id="what-consumerism-is-keeping-mefrom">What consumerism is keeping me from</h4>

<p>What if I had an ounce of this obsession, this compulsion, for God? What if I were to bottle this desire for consumerism and seek to “consume” God’s love and grace with even just a small portion of that desire? I don’t. And it’s this fact that makes this week rather depressing to me. Look at what I’m doling out my time and affection on and what it’s replacing. See the worthlessness of a computer compared to a Father. When I put it into that light, my silly little desire no longer seems harmless and trivial. No, it tears away my heart from the Love which it knew first. My consumerism, my selfishness and greed, blinds me from seeing what I <em>need</em>, that which is good and true. I’m trying to split time worshipping at the feet of two thrones, but really I’m neglecting the important one.</p>

<p>Where do you find your heart’s affections this bleak (it is here) Wednesday? On the eve (now that stores open tomorrow evening) of the biggest shopping day of the year, do you find yourself buying into the consumerism that is so ubiquitous in today’s society? Before we get caught up in the new “spirit” of the season, let’s take a step back and reevaluate. Instead of buying <em>stuff</em>, let’s buy ourselves a little more time with God, a little more time with our Father. Let’s trade the money and time spent shopping on valuable experiences with friends, family, and loved ones. Let us consume grace and love. Happy Thanksgiving, friends.</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p>I couldn’t let this blog sit fallow for an entire week. However, I will admit it’s been an emotionally rough week for me. It’s never fun when you realize the issues you have with relationships and intimacy are the same ones you were noticing almost four years ago. It’s not fun when you feel like you’re living a rewind of a past failed relationship. It’s even less fun returning to the same places with four more years of baggage than the last time you were there.</p>

<p>It makes you feel a little helpless, useless. I was feeling a little doomed to continue repeating the same habits ad nauseam without any ability to change course. It eats at my sense of self. It cuts at my worth. This helplessness produces a weight like lead, and it weighed every step, every breath this week. But somehow listening to the Little Drummer Boy this morning made it all a little better. Somehow, I have a hope for my current and future relationships. I have hope for my relationship with God, more importantly.</p>

<p>I have no gift to bring that fit to give the King. I played my drum for Him; I played my best for Him. Then He smiled at me. It’s a fictitious song about a baby smiling at a boy playing a drum, I get that fact. But, how true is the overarching narrative? I have nothing of value to bring the God of the universe. I bring nothing to the table, no credibility, no worth. Yet, He smiles at the pauper’s trinkets and junk I lay down at His feet. And that smile (I know it’s there) reminds me I’m not worthless. I’m not useless. He won’t leave me for dead. Even when He feels far off, He’s right there. He loves me too much for any of the doubts and the lies I believe to be true. Somehow, He values a relationship with me too much for any of it to be true.</p>

<p>I’m not entirely sure how to end this, friends. What’s eating at you? Where do you feel you’ve stagnated in your life, in your faith? Where do you feel destined to lament possibly for the rest of your days? Fret not, you won’t. Remember, you have a relationship with the Most High King. He loves you deeply. He cares infinitely. He won’t let you waste away. He will not idly stand by as you wither. He values you and your relationship far too much. He values you. He values every breath, thought, and action. You are more important than the rest of creation. You are worthy. Be loved today.</p>

            <blockquote>
  <p>“I am weary, tired of all the struggle. I want to know that at some point the war for my heart’s affections will die down and cease.” -</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don’t like to quote myself, however today I couldn’t resist. It’s Friday and I love Fridays, but it’s also Friday after a long week emotionally and spiritually for me. I’m physically tired from not sleeping. I’m weary from the questions. I’m drained from the seeking. I want to give up. I want to check out, call it a week (or two) and just disappear. <strong>But I can’t quit. I won’t.</strong> Here’s why.</p>

<h4 id="i-need-the-i-cantquit">I need the “I can’t quit”</h4>

<p>Really, I know I need this attitude. It’s plain and simple. If I quit today when the going is turbulent, but far from tumultuous, what precedent does that set? If I throw in the towel regarding my struggle today, what happens when something tougher comes my way? No, I need to know I can’t quit today. I need to know there are more battles for which I’m being prepared today. I need to know I can’t quit because I will be made to see victory.</p>

<h4 id="i-cant-quit-because-i-dont-needto">I can’t quit because I don’t need to</h4>

<p>I can’t quit because this battle was never mine to fight in the first place. I’ve wrestled control from my loving and capable Father once more. I don’t trust Him to <em>want</em> to provide today. I don’t trust Him to be as benevolent and loving as I claim. No, there are just some things that are too close to my chest, and I need to spring into action ensuring it’ll all end well. I’m tired of the striving, the vain effort; I want to quit, can’t quit. There’s nothing for me to quit if I just let go. But it’s so hard sometimes.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“For I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord, plans for welfare and not for evil, to give you a future and a hope. Then you will call upon me and come and pray to me, and I will hear you. You will seek me and find me, when you seek me with all your heart.” — <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jeremiah%2029:11-13&amp;version=ESV">Jeremiah 29:11–13</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>God already has plans for my good. They have been in motion since the foundations of the universe were set. He cares deeply about my joy. He is more than capable. He is the God who can’t quit. Though He rested on the seventh day, it wasn’t because He was tired, but because He was showing me, showing us, we need to take a break, step back and let Him be God. He showed that we can’t quit because He is in control and He will never quit. Quitting is just not what our God is about. Remember with me today, friends, <strong>we can’t quit</strong>.</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p>Storms are an inevitable part of life. Seems like they always have been and always will be. And I hate that fact. I want calm. I want peace. I am weary, tired of all the struggle. I want to know that at some point the war for my heart’s affections will die down and cease. However, that’s not where I am today, try as I might to get there. I’m not meant to be at that place today. But I’m learning that the storms have a distinct purpose, and it’s not just to throw me headlong into the breakers to drown.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One day [Jesus] got into a boat with his disciples, and he said to them, “Let us go across to the other side of the lake.” So they set out, and as they sailed he fell asleep. And a windstorm came down on the lake, and they were filling with water and were in danger. And they went and woke him, saying, “Master, Master, we are perishing!” And he awoke and rebuked the wind and the raging waves, and they ceased, and there was a calm. He said to them, “Where is your faith?” And they were afraid, and they marveled, saying to one another, “Who then is this, that he commands even winds and water, and they obey him?” — <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke%208:22-25&amp;version=ESV">Luke 8:22–25</a></p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="sleeping-through-thestorm">Sleeping through the storm</h4>

<p>I find it hard to believe Jesus didn’t know this storm was on its way. And given the fact that it caused lifelong fishermen to fear for their lives, I’m really wondering how He stayed asleep. But I think the important detail is Jesus knew the storm would hit and He wanted to see how His disciples would react. They panicked, just like we humans do, because their circumstances were grave and very real in the moment. They had never been delivered from such a storm. How could they expect to be saved from one such as this?</p>

<h4 id="calming-thestorm">Calming the storm</h4>

<p>Jesus rebuked the storm and it ceased. Jesus spoke. The storm ceased. Jesus took the opportunity to reveal a bit more about Himself through this storm. Jesus used a near-death experience to show, to physically put on display, His power to speak the weather into submission. The men that had only been called three chapters before, were taken to the brink of death so that Jesus could show them another facet to His being. Doesn’t God do this for us today?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Faith never prospers so well as when all things are against her: tempests are her trainers, and lightnings are her illuminators. When a calm reigns on the sea, spread the sails as you will, the ship moves not to its harbour; for on a slumbering ocean the keel sleeps too. Let the winds rush howling forth, and let the waters lift up themselves, then, though the vessel may rock, and her deck may be washed with waves, and her mast may creak under the pressure of the full and swelling sail, it is then that she makes headway towards her desired haven. — <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/devotionals/morning-and-evening/2013/11/12">November 12 Morning, “Morning and Evening” by Charles Spurgeon</a></p>

<h4 id="riding-out-thestorms">Riding out the storms</h4>

<p>Life without storms would be predictable and eventually get boring. Yes, these words are coming from the one who just wrote that he hates storms in life. I don’t understand how He does it, but God has used the storms in my life, and is currently doing so, to show me attributes and truths of Himself that I would not have understood or listened to at any other time. He has used calamity time and again to show me a love that is so visceral, personal, and deep as to even care about saving me from the breakers of life, small and large. He somehow uses the storms to reveal to me that His love is bigger, wider, taller, deeper than I will ever understand, but that He will also take the time to pull back the veil when I’m ready.</p>

<p>Storms in life do not show how mean or vengeful God is. No, they show me just the opposite. They show His love, affection, care, grace, and mercy. His salvation from these storms only highlights how awesome and loving He is. They show me that He is far more benevolent and Fatherly than I may ever comprehend. They show me that time and again He will stoop down and with a word calm the seas when I am about to drown. The storms show me that <strong>God is good</strong>.</p>

          <h2><a href="/another-day-another-year-older/">another day, another year older</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>I get pretty introspective at two times a year. Given the proximity of those times, it oftentimes ends up just blurring into a month and a half or so of introspection starting with my birthday and lasting through Christmas. So, you’ll have to excuse me if that’s where this blog goes for the foreseeable future. However, I’m not here to talk about introspection. I’m here instead to talk about growth and maturity.</p>

<h4 id="listening-to-the-doubts-of-gettingolder">Listening to the doubts of getting older</h4>

<p>A friend asked me this morning how it felt to be another year older, and I wasn’t sure how to respond. In that moment, I heard the whispering doubt now a decibel louder. It was saying, “You’ve now been on this earth for how long? And what do you have to show for it? What have you done with your life?” Needless to say, it made for a rather heavy ride into work.</p>

<h4 id="the-wisdom-of-gettingolder">The wisdom of getting older</h4>

<p>I’m still young, a baby to many with whom I’ve spoken, but I can honestly say I feel a hair wiser. And that wisdom tells me that while what I’ve done up to this point may not be tangible in many ways, but I am a full year wiser, more filled with God’s grace. And <em>that</em> I can see. How? God’s grace at work in our lives, the fruit that causes us to bear is obedience, and I can point to a few examples where I would not have obeyed previously. And friends, this gives me hope. Though I fear another year may have gone down the drain, that doubt is erased through the realization that growing older has brought with it a measure of obedience, and that is worth more than the year spent chasing it down.</p>

<p>Maybe you’re feeling somewhat similar to me today, friend. Take heart! Though you may not see colossal strides toward the finish line, remember that obedience, the delighting in God’s good, perfect and pleasing will, is fruit itself and that fruit is worth more than its weight in gold. Be encouraged today. You are loved deeply by a Father who is beaming with pride in <em>you</em>. Though you are another day older, you are not older in vain. No, He is working in you very tangibly, steadfast toward your sanctification and His glory. Happy Friday!</p>

<p>It’s mornings like Sunday and notes like those above that make me glad I carry around my tattered notebook in my back pocket. Maybe it’s trying to take stock of twenty-six years of journeying. Perhaps I’m feeling a tinge older. Whatever the reason, here’s where I’m at today. Here’s what’s churning around my jumpstart mind this brisk morning. However, what’s important is where these questions are leading me. What’s important is I see some obvious room for improvement, and I see where I’ve been off-track in my thinking for as long as I care to remember.</p>

<h4 id="piecemeal-heartchange">Piecemeal heart change</h4>

<p>I’ve always been looking for the next piece of my heart that needed to change. Haphazardly, I’ve gone about looking at heart change as if each piece of the puzzle, each piece of my unbreaking heart was the puzzle itself. Mistaking the forest for the trees is no way to become whole again. This is no strategy at all, this is the wayward journey.</p>

<h4 id="heart-change-with-aplan">Heart change with a plan</h4>

<p>What I realized yesterday afternoon is that heart change (by the grace of God) will happen even haphazardly, but it can only get us so far until we see the bigger picture. Change can only become complete when we see that change as leading us to our ultimate goal. Change only becomes meaningful when we acknowledge God in our innermost being and stop trying to put up the walls of insecurity. Change is only consuming when we stop looking for the next last piece of the puzzle, and instead accept the puzzle for the lifelong journey it was always meant to be. Things like letting go of my right to be understood are good, but alone will never make me whole. No, God thankfully made the heart far more complex than that.</p>

<p>Change was never meant to make us better people, better friends, better potential soulmates. No, heart change, true change, is meant to bring us into a more intimate and fulfilling relationship with God. Those other aspects are mere mile markers along the way. Sure, we should all strive to be better people, but what does that amount to a hundred years from now? And like all things that matter, change doesn’t happen overnight. Change isn’t bought, delivered by some change fairy, or realized from a single micro-adjustment. Change, lasting, fulfilling change, is only realized through a concerted effort to draw closer to the Loving Father who is helping us every step along the way. And it is only accomplished through His help and guidance one step at a time. Hallelujah.</p>

          <h2><a href="/original-sin-in-need-of-a-savior/">original sin: in need of a savior</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>Anyone who’s read this blog for any length of time knows I don’t like to dip my toe into the theological pool. Honestly, I’m not qualified in any way to do so. However, in light of the fact that this seems to be where I am, allow me to share with you what I’m learning about the oft troubling topic of original sin. Because I know it’s been a tricky piece of theology and I fear some of us take it a tinge too far.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Therefore, just as sin came into the world through one man, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men because all sinned — for sin indeed was in the world before the law was given, but sin is not counted where there is no law. — <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans%205:12-13&amp;version=ESV">Romans 5:12–13</a></p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="original-sin-referenced">Original sin referenced</h4>

<p>Romans 5:12 is a verse often used in conjunction with supporting original sin. And, to note, I wholeheartedly agree with the doctrine and believe this is a great reference. The danger here is reading too much into it. I don’t disagree with the fact that the author is restating the claim in Romans 3:23 that all have sinned and fall short of God’s perfection. I know all too well that our imperfect judgment leads our decisions astray. I believe we are also free to make those decisions. However, I cannot find any proof in this quote that God sees all his children as sinful the moment or even before they leave the womb.</p>

<h4 id="the-slippery-slope-of-original-sin-atbirth">The slippery slope of original sin at birth</h4>

<p>If we are to argue that babies leave the womb as sinful beings, then Jesus has some questions to answer. If we are to hold true that Jesus was fully man <em>and</em> fully God, then the man of Him was sinful. At birth, Jesus would have been a sinner in need of redemption. Thus, on the cross, Jesus could not have been the propitiation of sin, because He would have known sin, even if not very well. If humans are sinful at birth, we’re all hell bound and God ceases to be benevolent. This is not my God. This is no Father of whom I want any part.</p>

<h4 id="i-still-believe-in-originalsin">I still believe in original sin</h4>

<p>Original sin states that we all are fallible, imperfect beings, with a propensity for making poor decisions, in need of redemption. We are surrounded by people in the same boat. And only God can deliver that ship to safety from the breakers of life. Original sin is not that we are sinful, but that we are more than capable of choosing to sin. The sin itself is a byproduct of our obvious imperfection and ignorance.</p>

<p>I realize I leave a lot of questions and loose ends with this post, but I have no mind to get into the topics of predestination, judgment, or salvation here and now. I know from experience that we are all sinful, prone to making poor decisions resulting from imperfect judgment processes. Feel free to disagree with me, but I cannot see a loving God casting babies into hellfire for simply being born. I cannot see birth and humanity as the only prerequisites for being labelled a hell-bound sinner. Because I still hold out hope that in God’s love, He made the ultimate sacrifice to show me once and for all that He loves me more than life itself. I still cling desperately onto the knowledge that God is Love, and that Love will go to any length to show the beloved how loved it truly is. This is original sin, and this is my God.</p>

          <h2><a href="/relationship-broken-an-open-letter-from-the-heart/">relationship broken: an open letter from the heart</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>I have to admit, I felt prompted to write this post and I’ve been fighting it since that thought entered my mind yesterday. I don’t want to let you into certain struggles in my life. I don’t want to let you into the unfinished mess of my heart, but I alluded to a conversation two weeks ago and a prayer that helped get me through the first few days after that conversation. I’m here to let you into that conversation and where I’ve been brought since.</p>

<h4 id="relationship-broken">Relationship broken</h4>

<p>“It’s not enough,” the words rattled my bones as I sat in the shockwave of a response that felt like a small nuclear bomb. I knew that’s what she’d say, but hearing her tell me that the lack of certainty I was offering wasn’t going to cut it for her in a relationship immediately sent me into self-preservative shock. And I fought the loud echo, “<em>You’re</em> not enough,” bouncing off the rafters of my skull. It stung. Badly.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Abba, I abandon myself into your hands. Do with me what you will. Whatever you may do, I thank you. I am ready for all: I accept all. Let your will be done in me and in all your creatures. I wish no more than this, O Lord. Into your hands I commend my spirit. I offer it to you with all the love of my heart, for I love you, Lord, and I will give myself, surrender myself into your hands without reserve, with boundless confidence, <em>for your are my Father</em>.” — Charles Foucauld</p>
</blockquote>

<p>God, I don’t know why You’re putting me through this, but I’m going to follow. Well, I’m going to do my best. And it’s hurt. Truthfully, everyday I’ve felt the sting of the breaking of that relationship. For a relationship that <em>wasn’t</em> a relationship, wasn’t labelled a relationship, it sure stings like one.</p>

<p>However, it’s forced me to question what I love most. And nine days out of ten, it’s not God, but what He’s given. Those nine days, I choose comfort without a second’s thought. Nine days out of ten, I want to settle for the lie that someone else will make me whole; I don’t want to fight for the wholeness that only God can offer, can promise. It’s a lot harder to settle for this, though, when “she” isn’t around. It’s a lot harder when it’s just you and God. And therein lies the blessing of the last two weeks.</p>

<h4 id="relationship-hole">Relationship hole</h4>

<p>Driving home from Erik’s brother’s wedding, in spite of how completely enjoyable it all was (possibly the most fun I’ve had in a wedding weekend), the burning hole that screams “I want that partner, as well” is still painfully vocal. Despite knowing what I know, learning what God has taught thus far, there is the ever-present pang that wants to cut me down at the knees, drag me kicking and screaming from the wholeness I so desperately crave, need. However, I can’t tell you if I’m convinced that wholeness and this particular relationship are mutually exclusive. Maybe I’m being too honest, but here’s my heart. I see maybe the next step, but as far as this relationship’s concerned, I have no clue beyond that. And so I must surrender myself completely, abandon my heart, to my loving Father. Because if nothing else, He is good.</p>

<p>What is it for you that’s got your heart in a bind? What is it that you’re struggling with currently? Where do you need guidance? Where do you need to see God’s goodness in action? I encourage you to be honest and open about it. Even if, <em>especially if</em>, it hurts. Relationship? Job? Child? Sickness? Share it with those around you. Share it with God. Abandon yourself to prayer. Abandon yourself to Abba, loving Father, caring Dad. Let Go(d) today.</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p>I had something entirely different planned for today’s post, but I read this article about <a href="http://storylineblog.com/2013/10/23/why-i-quit-being-nice/">how being nice can stifle relationships</a> and I realized this went along all too well with what I’ve mulled over this past week or so. I realize that long ago, I bought into the lie that being Christian meant simply rolling over in relationships, not rocking the boat, that turning the other cheek meant letting the other person afflict you again and again in the same way. <strong>I’ve lived as if Christianity required you to be spineless, self-doubting, unconfident</strong>. I’m sorry. I’ve been wrong all these years. Can you forgive me?</p>

<h4 id="nice-thedoormat">Nice: the doormat</h4>

<p>Being nice has caused me to be a doormat in many relationships. It stifles and poisons relationships in two ways. One, it doesn’t help the other person treat others the way we’re meant to be treated. Nice doesn’t lovingly correct mistreatment, it refuses to rock the boat; nice reinforces bad relationships and bad relationship habits. Two, being nice reinforces to ourselves that we are second class citizens worthy only of maltreatment and abuse. God doesn’t create for this purpose, much less did He create men and women to settle for this filth. No, we are the daughters and sons of God; we are made to bask in His love and mercy.</p>

<h4 id="where-nice-and-kinddiverge">Where nice and kind diverge</h4>

<p>While nice is preoccupied in steadying the proverbial boat, kind is throwing into the water those that need to learn to swim, then jumping in with a life raft to make sure they don’t drown. Nice downright ignores (on the surface) wrongdoing, while kind acknowledges it and seeks to correct it. Nice is spineless, accepting of evil, while kind stands up for what is good and right.</p>

<h4 id="nice-in-mylife">Nice in my life</h4>

<p>As I read the words I type, tears fill my eyes. I see the dichotomy I am trying to highlight and I see how far I’ve erred on the side of being “nice.” I see how I am not the only one. I see flashbacks of broken relationships and how easily they could have been righted by a light rocking of the boat in kindness. I see how backwards and insecure I am as a result of the constant harm being “nice” has inflicted on myself. And I see how easy it would be to merely settle for continuing the trend. But that is death. We were made for life, friend.</p>

<p>Maybe kind is the wrong word to use, but I hope you see what I’m getting at with not settling for being “nice.” When our conduct stops at nice, we all lose. We’re no longer pointing one another toward God and His holiness. We’re no longer living in community, rolling up our sleeves together and living out the dark, dirty places we all will and must travel. We’re ignoring the hard work, disqualifying ourselves from the reward during and after the process. To put it bluntly, being nice is killing me and it’s killing you. As children of the God of Life, we don’t have time for that. So what do you say we quit being “nice” today, friend?</p>

<h4 id="gods-proud-of-you-as-he-was-yesterday">God’s proud of you, as He was yesterday</h4>

<p>Before time, God made you; perfectly, He arranged every cell, saw each one of your days (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalm%20139:13-16&amp;version=ESV">Psalm 139:13–16</a>). He loved you before you were ever you. If God is perfect and He made you, how could you have been made anything less than perfectly? No, this is not who God is. He saw the plans He had for you and before the earth was created, He was proud. Today, God’s proud.</p>

<h4 id="gods-proud-of-youtoday">God’s proud of you today</h4>

<p>We have the assurance that God is working all things for the good of those who love Him (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans%208:28-29&amp;version=ESV">Romans 8:28–29</a>). If this is true, and we are coming from a place of being prized in God’s heart, then how can it be that God would not be proud of you today? Yes, we fall down, get dirty, love lesser things, worship false gods, and sometimes each of these happens within the same hour. OK, maybe that’s just me, but you get where I’m going with that. We will mess up till the day each of us dies. However, God’s proud of you today. With each falling short, He whispers to our defiant heart, “I’m hurt, but I love you and I’m very proud of who you are and what you’re becoming. Come on, let’s go clean you up.” Today, God’s proud of you, friend.</p>

<h4 id="gods-proud-of-you-tomorrow-even">God’s proud of you tomorrow, even</h4>

<p>And if God’s plans for you truly are good, then why should God not be proud of you tomorrow? See, our place in God’s heart is a result of His unchanging grace and love. Because God is love, because God is good, our position as the daughters and sons of God has been secured forever. There is not a thing we could do to loose ourselves from His tremendous, everlasting love. He will never leave us. He will never forsake us. He is ours and we are His, forever and ever. For every tomorrow, we are reminded that God’s proud.</p>

<p>If God’s proud of us, what then have we to fear of the rejection of people? If God’s proud of us, who then can we ultimately let down? Sure, we will disappoint and fall short time and again, but our identity, our validation is secured in the One who secured the foundations of the universe. Before time, today, tomorrow, God’s proud of you, of us. Because of His love, His utter perfection, we will always remain the apple of His eye. There is nothing we need to do to earn that favor. It’s ours. It will always be ours. Now, let’s take that and move on to more important preoccupations with our lives. Go get ’em today, friend. God’s proud of you.</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p>After the shuttering of this blog last week for neglecting to pay my hosting fees, this return feels rather underwhelming. It’s kind of like (this is a terrible analogy) Jesus riding back into town on the young donkey. Yes, I neglected to pay the people who hosted this website and that’s why there was no post on Monday…or Thursday. However, I was able to prevail over hosting companies, website migration, and databases (don’t get me started). I’m just glad to be back. And friends, I feel refreshed after my near two weeks away.</p>

<p>On that note, from now on, I will not simply post on a schedule to post words on the internet. I encourage you to “cojourn with me” through subscribing to this blog via email if you don’t want to miss a post in the future. Not that I feel the content recently has been bad, but there have been far too many mornings that have felt less than my best, less than inspired. And I want to curtail those, if not end them altogether. You deserve more. So, now I offer you a teaser of what I’ve been learning, and of what I’ll go into more detail regarding next week. Yes, I’ve already lined up a couple posts (by no fault of my own) for y’all.</p>

<h4 id="god-is-proud-ofyou">God is proud of you</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>“God, <strong>You’re proud of me</strong>. You’re proud of who I am <em>today</em>. You’re proud of who You’re making me to be <em>tomorrow</em>. You love me with a love <strong>fiercer</strong> than anything I’ve ever known. You are <em>for</em> me, and there is <em>nothing</em> that can ever change that fact. You are my ever-loving <strong>Father</strong>. You are not just my dad, but <strong>You are my Dad</strong>. Thank You.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s a paraphrase of a quiet time I had last weekend. Have you ever come to terms with the fact that God is indeed proud of who you are this very minute? Are you aware that the person you are right now is exactly who He wants you to be at this very moment? Are you in unaware that He has held your hand every step along the way as a proud father guides the first steps of his most cherished young one? Well, think about it. Because, that realization has the power to change lives.</p>

<h4 id="if-we-abandon-ourselves-tohim">If we abandon ourselves to Him…</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Abba, I abandon myself into your hands. Do with me what you will. Whatever you may do, I thank you. I am ready for all: I accept all. Let your will be done in me and in all your creatures. I wish no more than this, O Lord. Into your hands I commend my spirit. I offer it to you with all the love of my heart, for I love you, Lord, and I will give myself, surrender myself into your hands without reserve, with boundless confidence, <em>for your are my Father</em>.” — Charles Foucauld</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I found this gem of a prayer reading on in <em>The Ragamuffin Gospel</em> last weekend. To make a long story short, I had read this prayer out of order right before having a tough conversation. Since that conversation, I’ve needed to pray those words once a day this week. Those words also have the power to change lives. They have the power to loose the frail illusion of control I have over my situation and recognize under whose reign they rightly fall. They speak of reckless abandon of rights, comfort, assurance. They speak of a craziness that scares me to death. However, I know in my core that death might just bring about life truer than I could ever know otherwise. Maybe…</p>

<p>And so I leave you all with these two seeds of insight into my life and what God’s been doing in it the past couple weeks. I hope, I pray as I type this, that this post finds you well and speaks to your soul. If you struggle with either of these topics, maybe try praying through the quotes. God is proud of you. And if you abandon yourself to Him, He will not let you down. If you’d rather not go that route and you don’t have someone else to speak to, you have my contact info on the <a href="http://104.193.143.57/~waywar13/ce/about/">About</a> page. Don’t hesitate to email me. I wish you all peace this Friday and the subsequent weekend. Till Monday, friends.</p>

            <p>At some point during Sunday’s service, it hit me. It was a bit of a chilling realization, but I knew it to be true. I knew in that moment that there were aspects of my faith I was not willing to touch, to prod, to examine. I was afraid that my faith as a result would come tumbling down on top of me like a deck of cards. I’m afraid that I’ll be left alone, left for dead, forsaken by the god who can’t stand under such examination. In a way, I’m afraid that God can’t take exploration, questioning, discovery. I’m afraid He’ll finally cut me out of His will for my overwhelming questioning and doubt. And so I must go into the proverbial desert. <strong>Alone</strong>.</p>

<p>If you’ve read the Bible enough, you realize the desert is a common motif in the faith journey. Moses spends forty years wandering the desert. Jesus spends His forty days of being tested in the desert. The desert in the Bible is synonymous for trial. Often, that trial must be ventured alone. And the journeyer is never left unchanged. In Moses’ case, you could argue he doesn’t leave the desert until he is a new man. But the desert is meant to change, is meant to test, try, and shape people.</p>

<h4 id="taking-a-hiatus-while-in-thedesert">Taking a hiatus while in the desert</h4>

<p>Sorry to do this to the faithful, but I’m taking a break from blogging (and all social media) for the next week. I want this to be a time of true contemplation, focus. I must take this spiritual journey alone, but I know that in spirit I am anything but. I have not been willing to give it all to follow Christ, and now I must give up the rest, my best. Yes, I’m afraid — terrified even — but I know that what I stand to gain from this time is far more valuable than anything I may give up in the process. Most of all, I know I must take this first step into the desert. After that, your guess as to what’s next is as good as mine.</p>

<p>When was the last time you went into the desert, friend? When was the last time you dropped the pretenses, the excuses, the preoccupations, and just sought the face of God? What’s holding you back? Of what cannot you not seem to let go? Is it really more valuable than the presence of God? No, it’s not. Seek away, my friends. I will be doing the same.</p>

          <h2><a href="/prayer-meditation-and-suffocating-spirituality/">prayer, meditation and suffocating spirituality</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>I know from my own life that the world just moves faster than it used to. Long gone are the days of waiting days or weeks for news or mail. Long gone are the days when people can just take off for days at a time and go meditate in the wilderness. Heck, I have a hard enough time “meditating” on a few verses in the morning for even ten minutes. And don’t even get me started on my prayer life. However, these things go hand in hand. Together, they constitute how we breathe spiritually. Without them, we’re just holding our breaths, turning purple. But what do we do?</p>

<h4 id="why-prayer-and-meditation">Why prayer and meditation?</h4>

<p>If God is life, then what are we doing to take part in that? Prayer, meditation are the two best ways of immersing ourselves in the presence and being of God. I mean, how else are we going to get in touch with Him? Last time I checked, He doesn’t have iMessage…But, I digress. Praying, honestly and humbly bringing ourselves before God in prayer, is how we reconnect with Him and experience Him throughout the day. Meditation is how we take that relationship a step further. Meditation is where God becomes intimate and we shed the mental shroud that hides His personable nature.</p>

<h4 id="prayer-as-breathing">Prayer as breathing</h4>

<p>What could prayer have in common with breathing? We’re supposed to do both just as often! OK, all hokeyness aside, prayer helps us to exhale the lies and the doubts we’re struggling with at the moment. Prayer also helps us breathe in the truths and assurances God gives us in response. The waste, the carbon dioxide, we give to a God who waits for it with open arms. The fresh air is His love. And we need both of these for a healthy soul.</p>

<h4 id="meditation-the-extension-ofprayer">Meditation: the extension of prayer</h4>

<p>Meditation, in the breathing analogy, is the deep breath we need from time to time. Meditation is the long, slow, deliberate breath of God’s truth. Meditation allows us to marinate in an aspect of God’s love, His being, and let it sink deeper than prayer alone allows. Meditation forces us to linger in God’s presence, enabling a deeper, more intimate, and truer understanding of Him. Isn’t that scary?</p>

<p>I’ve explained prayer and meditation, but now comes the crux of this post. How do we bring it about more in our lives? I see why these are desirable in my life, but how do I make it happen? How do I truly have a living and breathing faith? This is what I’ll be spending the next few days contemplating. Right now, I don’t have an answer for you. I merely have a desire. And maybe that is the answer to prayer and meditation. What do you think? Is this kind of faith even something you feel you’re lacking right now?</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p>Where does this Monday morning find you, friend? Are you tired? Are you weary? Are you reaching the end of your rope? Are you frazzled already? Are you stressed? Could you use a little encouragement?</p>

<p>I woke up this morning and the topic I’d chosen yesterday just didn’t seem to fit anymore. Instead of sharing with you my opinion on some piece of theology, or telling you what I’m learning, I just want to offer a little encouragement as we start our weeks. Maybe you don’t find yourself in any of the conditions I listed above, but I know my soul could use the reminder of a few truths, and I know I’m not the only one.</p>

<h4 id="god-stillreigns">God still reigns</h4>

<p>Though it may not seem so right now, God is still firmly in control of the universe. He is sovereign over all, capable of handling the details great and small.</p>

<h4 id="god-loves-you-more-than-youll-everknow">God loves you more than you’ll ever know</h4>

<p>God’s love for you is fiercer than a hurricane, more vast than the cosmos. He is whispering to you even now how much He loves you, how proud He is of you. Of all that He has created, you are His pride and joy.</p>

<h4 id="god-cares-intimately">God cares intimately</h4>

<p>Our Father cares about the smallest, tiniest details of our lives. He cares about those little hurts that we incur throughout the day. He cares about our disappointments and our triumphs. He is right there in it all. And it’s because He loves you <em>that</em> much.</p>

<p>I want to keep this encouragement short, friend. I know it’s not an exhaustive list. But it’s meant to be a start. It’s meant to maybe point you back toward the God of Love we find all throughout the Bible. There, you can find encouragement in whatever you need. There, you will find the strength for whatever your day may throw at you. There is where I not only find encouragement, but hope. Happy Monday, friend.</p>

I feel like my heart has been clamoring for peace over the past couple weeks. Work’s been a crazy-maker as of late, I haven’t been sleeping well, and I’m still trying to find a place of sorts in the new-ish surroundings. Needless to say, I need something to calm my soul right about now. I need something to remind me more consistently of the peace that is available to me throughout the day (and night). And I think this song, the way I connect with it right now, is helping toward that end. So is this passage:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Lord reigns; he is robed in majesty; the Lord is robed; he has put on strength as his belt. Yes, the world is established; it shall never be moved. Your throne is established from of old; you are from everlasting. The floods have lifted up, O Lord, the floods have lifted up their voice; the floods lift up their roaring. Mightier than the thunders of many waters, mightier than the waves of the sea, the Lord on high is mighty! Your decrees are very trustworthy;<br />
holiness befits your house, O Lord, forevermore.<br />
- <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalm%2093&amp;version=ESV">Psalm 93</a></p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="he-will-calm-mysoul">He will calm my soul</h4>

<p>The God that is just as in control yesterday as He is today and will always be will indeed calm my soul. He is more than strong enough to do so. He’s more than loving enough to bring peace to calamity. He is mightier than the tempest in my heart. The flood waters in which my soul some days feels it is drowning are but ripples to Him. Yes, Him, He will calm my soul.</p>

<p>No, I’m not at peace as I write this. No, I read this before bed last night and still tossed and turned. Things are not OK right here and now, but I know they are on the upswing. I have more than a hollow hope that God will soon calm my soul. In fact, I know that God is answering that prayer as I type. He is putting out the fires, taming the seas, quelling those fears. He is showing me once again that He is good, He is love, and He is full of a kind of grace I may never understand. Friend, do you find yourself in a similar place this morning? Ask and He is big enough to calm your soul, too.</p>

          <h2><a href="/the-god-who-doesnt-settle/">the god who doesn’t settle</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>You’ll have to pardon me if I’m a little behind the curve on this one. Maybe I’m a tad slow, or perhaps I’m just that stubborn. Regardless of the reason, I’m coming to find that while I may be content to settle for lesser things, God is not. I pray for small miracles and God lets me down. Instead, He provides beyond my imagination. I’m learning God is too <em>big</em> to settle. I’m learning God is too <em>good</em> to settle. But it’s not because God <em>can’t</em> settle.</p>

<h4 id="a-god-too-big-tosettle">A God too big to settle</h4>

<p>God is bigger than my one problem. He is bigger than a car crash. He is larger than my mortgage payment. It’s not that He doesn’t care about me and what happens in my life, quite the opposite. His plans are just bigger than a single event, bigger than a single concern. His plans for our lives are bigger than the stars. So, God will sometimes let us down in our small prayers. He will disappoint us, but only so that He can make way for greater blessings.</p>

<h4 id="a-god-too-good-tosettle">A God too good to settle</h4>

<p>God will settle for nothing less than providing for us His best. This is goodness. Goodness will break our heart, so that it can put back the pieces, cleaning each one delicately in the process. He will allow for me to be a wreck after this relationship, so that He can prepare me for a better one. He will dash my plans to go out to this event, so that I would run into that person and have that deeper conversation.</p>

<h4 id="a-god-who-wontsettle">A God who won’t settle</h4>

<p>There is nothing God cannot do, but God chooses not to settle. He is too big, too good to settle. His love is far to great for Him to provide anything less than perfect for the children that are the apple of His eye. If God has already given us His everything, why would He stop now? God always has more in store for us. Just because He doesn’t answer what we’ve been praying for for the longest time doesn’t mean He’s done providing. No, it means that He will not settle for either giving it to us in the wrong time or for something less than what He has in mind for us. And it’s always better. Always.</p>

<p>God won’t settle to provide for us anything less than His absolute best. He’s too good, He’s too loving, He’s too big to give us any less than that. But therein lies the problem for this all-things-on-demand millennial. I want a vending machine, not a God. However, I’m learning that God may actually know my heart more intimately than I ever will. And scary as that is, it’s the highest affirmation I could ever receive. So here’s to the disappointments. May they make way for blessing beyond our imaginations today.</p>

          <h2><a href="/three-things-i-learned-from-the-first-missionary-56a485cfd2b/">three things i learned from the first missionary</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>You may remember me talking about <a href="http://104.193.143.57/~waywar13/ce/what-a-town-slut-taught-me-about-silence/" title="What a Town Slut Taught Me About Silence">Jesus and the woman at the well</a> on Monday. Well, this is a continuation of my marinating on that passage. It’s just the beginning of a new outlook on what it means to live a life transformed by the love and grace of Jesus, the beauty in the story He’s writing that is my life, and what sharing the love, the grace, the beauty looks like.</p>

<h4 id="transformation-makes-the-missionary">Transformation makes the missionary</h4>

<p>If you blink during Jesus’ conversation with this woman, you will miss the transformation. After she’s tried to run with her half-truth in verse 17, then retreated to religion in verse 20, there is a notable shift in her language. There is the longing for the Messiah, the end to her confusion and hurt. And then she realizes she’s met Him. Upon meeting Him, she can do nothing but run and share Him. Should this not be our reaction to Jesus when we meet Him? Should this not be our reaction when He reveals Himself anew to us in our prayer, or in a sunset? Putting on our “missionary cap” (yes, that’s meant to be hokey) should be our first reaction.</p>

<h4 id="missionary-of-the-beauty-of-imperfection">Missionary of the beauty of imperfection</h4>

<p>What we in the Church like to gloss over is the fact that the woman probably went home to the man who wasn’t her husband. Her life wasn’t immediately transformed on the spot, but her shame was. That’s the only thing that changed about this woman at the well. The weight of shame over her past was lifted. No longer was her focus on her shortcomings, but on the understanding and the visible care of Jesus. And it is this that she wanted to share with others. Maybe she realized it then, maybe not, but her past which was painfully known by her neighbors provided a backdrop for the brilliance of grace, rather than a sheet covering grace. Her past was no longer something to be ashamed of. And neither was her present.</p>

<h4 id="missionary-oflove">Missionary of love</h4>

<p>Evangelism is a dirty term nowadays. It’s been tarnished by years of this missionary shouting at pagans, that missionary engaging in scandal after scandal, and countless other burdens we humans place on religion. However, evangelism is simply the open declaration of the gospel. It is sharing the beauty that God is working in a life that may otherwise be ordinary, or even downright ugly. It’s this gospel that transformed a town slut (as she was seen) into history’s first recorded evangelist. And what did she say to her neighbors? She didn’t tell them they were all condemned to hell. She didn’t tell them they needed salvation or even why. She only said, “Come, see a man who told me all that I ever did. Can this be the Christ?” All she did was show them to Jesus. This is what a missionary should be. Using her life as the context, she pointed her neighbors gently and lovingly toward the man, toward God, who loved her for who she was.</p>

<p>Because the Kingdom of Heaven is the now and not yet, we have to be comfortable with the fact that we as missionaries will be imperfect. We will stumble over our words. We will sin. We will fail. We have failed multiple times in the past. However, this makes the grace and love of Jesus no less salient. In fact, I argue it makes it more so. Yes, we are different, but in that our shame no longer defines us. We are the same as we were yesterday, only we have seen and accepted the loving forgiveness of the kind Messiah at the well. Our stories are messy, dirty, and we’d rather hide them. But it is our stories that connect us with those around us. It is our stories that bring credence to the greatness of God’s infinite love. It is our stories that give us a platform to point others toward a Savior who deeply loves and cares for even the town outcast. Today, be a missionary, friend. However you do it, share the love of Jesus with someone today. You have no reason not to.</p>

          <h2><a href="/what-a-town-slut-taught-me-about-silence/">what a town slut taught me about silence</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>I wrote last week about running from the silence. I told you how when confronted by silence, I hid. When face to face with my loving Lord, I chose to disengage and instead opted for shame. Yesterday, I went to church and heard another message on the familiar story of Jesus and the Samaritan woman at the well. This woman, seen as the town slut, I’m sure, taught me something. You see, the difference between myself and her is that while she tried to evade Jesus in the conversation, she didn’t run. She stuck with it. And as a result, we have the beautiful exchange recorded in <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john%204:1-45&amp;version=ESV">John 4</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Jesus said to her, “Go, call your husband, and come here.” The woman answered him, “I have no husband.” Jesus said to her, “You are right in saying, ‘I have no husband’; for you have had five husbands, and the one you now have is not your husband. What you have said is true.” — John 4:16–18</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="hiding-from-thesilence">Hiding from the silence</h4>

<p>While it seems a cruel trick for Jesus to tell the woman to call her husband, He’s giving her a chance to be real with Him. She answers a half-truth, trying to hide the lie of omission. You see, she’d been rejected by five men at that point. She was hurt. She was probably woefully hurt, in fact. At best, she was a second class citizen in her town, fetching water in the middle of the day because she didn’t want to deal with the condescension and the judgment of the other women of the town. Can you blame her?</p>

<h4 id="healing-in-thesilence">Healing in the silence</h4>

<p>While an odd exchange, Jesus’ blunt recanting of this woman’s past is not in fact condemning. It is little more than Him relaying to the woman that He knows her. He’s trying to get her to let go of the great burden of shame of five failed marriages. He’s trying to break through the facade. He’s trying to reveal what she wants to stay hidden, because only He can heal. And in only a few sentences, He does.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So the woman left her water jar and went away into town and said to the people, 29 “Come, see a man who told me all that I ever did. Can this be the Christ?” 30 They went out of the town and were coming to him. — John 4:28–30</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="silence-brings-for-the-first-missionary">Silence brings for the first missionary</h4>

<p>From the well, the woman leaves her water jug and runs to tell the town about “the Christ”. The very people she was too afraid to be judged and condemned by are the very first people she runs and tells about Jesus. You see the shame that led her to avoid the other women of the town has all but melted away. Through the crucible of this strange, seemingly terse interaction, her overbearing boulder of shame has burned away. And she has a message that must be heard by her once-tormentors.</p>

<p>This is precisely what Jesus does to us in the silence. If we stick with it, even if we hide a little, He is still good enough to fill in the blanks for us. He is still loving enough to expose our darkness. It’s awkward. It’s uncomfortable. But it’s healing. It is the staying through the discomfort that brings us closer to wholeness. It’s in the silence that seemingly sharp words cut through the thick shroud of shame. Don’t run, friends. He is for you and wants to heal you.</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p>I know the title’s a little foreboding, but you’ll soon understand why. So, the unthinkable of unthinkables happened Monday: my phone died and I didn’t have my charger nearby (within 20 miles). And then, I was feeling rundown Tuesday, so I didn’t go to work Tuesday, thus I didn’t retrieve said charger. There my phone sat, cold, lifeless. I have a Mac desktop and a tablet, so I was still relatively connected Tuesday, but then I left the house to go to Bible study. And that’s when the real happening began: spare my iPod (with no WiFi), <strong>I was technology-less, disconnected completely from this digital world. And I liked it</strong>.</p>

<h4 id="first-bestill">First, be still</h4>

<p>What did we ever do without technology? Simply, we had less to distract us from being still. I took the metro to Bible study, so what other option did I have but to be still? Sure, I could’ve retreated into my music, but I wasn’t in that kind of a mood. I was still. Painfully still. And in the stillness, I came to one of the worst realizations you can come to in the moment which is that it’s been far too long since the last time that happened. It scared the crap out of me. And I forced myself to be still a little longer.</p>

<h4 id="be-still-a-littlelonger">Be still a little longer</h4>

<p>Unnerved as I was, not knowing where to start, I simply started breathing and repeating under my breath “God, I don’t know the words.” When you’re truly approaching the Alpha and Omega, it’s supposed to be a scary thing. At least that’s what I’ve come to believe through reading and past experience. “Where do we begin catching up, what do I say, what should I say, am I thinking too much?!” the thoughts racing through my mind. All of a sudden, as my thoughts reached a fever pitch, it broke just as suddenly as the din had begun.</p>

<h4 id="just-bestill">Just be still</h4>

<p>And that’s the time when I broke. I couldn’t take it anymore, so I retreated back to the silence of myself. Or should I say, I retreated from the silence back to the comfortable noise of my incoherent thoughts, irrational fears, my Indie music. I retreated back to the meaningless. And in that moment, I was alone. I can’t recall a more lonely train ride.</p>

<p>There’s a reason we’re told to “Be still, and know that I am God.” (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+46:10&amp;version=ESV">Psalm 46:10</a>) God could very easily cut through the noise with a voice that brings universes into being. But it’s far more beautiful for Him to restrain this power and speak to us in the silence. It’s far more poetic that He would wait for us in the silence, gently whispering for us to be still, child. Let’s not lose sight of the fact that He’s still God and His mere presence is almost too much for us to behold. He is mighty, but He is gentle. And He’s waiting for us in the stillness. Let’s go to Him today in confidence, friends.</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <blockquote>
  <p>Faith is creative.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A mere three words, but seeing those Saturday morning as I read the morning portion of Spurgeon’s <em>Morning and Evening</em> stuck with me. I’m still thinking about them. I’m still thinking about the account in Luke of the sick man who was lowered through the roof so Jesus could heal him. I’m still thinking about the brazenness, the stupidity, and the callousness of what they did. On the surface, you have a bunch of jerks who couldn’t wait through the line, so the jumped up on a roof, destroyed property, and cut in front of so many people. I mean, who did these people think they were?!</p>

<h4 id="creative-deviance">Creative deviance</h4>

<p>Sure, they cut a hole in a roof, but you can’t say these people weren’t brazen. You can’t say they weren’t bold. It takes a lot of guts and a heck of a lot of crazy to hoist a bed-ridden man up onto a roof. And this is just the kind of crazy Jesus respected. It’s the kind of crazy that doesn’t accept any obstacle as an excuse for failure. It’s the kind of crazy that doesn’t let anything stand between us and the Healer. In a certain light, doesn’t being creative make us a little crazy?</p>

<h4 id="creative-faith-isnt-malicious">Creative faith isn’t malicious</h4>

<p>As a means of disclaimer, I’m not promoting that anyone should routinely hack holes in others’ roofs. To be honest, the act itself seems a little extreme to me, but it’s important to note these men were not intending to hurt anyone and probably didn’t really want to destroy the roof in the first place, but I digress.</p>

<h4 id="creative-faith-overcomes">Creative faith overcomes</h4>

<p>Creative faith is faith that is heavenbent (see what I did there?) on making Jesus our sole focus. Creative faith loves Him so much that it will always find a way to be with the object of its affection, its desire. Creative faith is ruthless in its love. At the same time, creative faith is bold in its tenderness. Creative faith knows no failure, because this faith will always find a way, even if it means exercising a little craziness in the pursuit.</p>

<p>And that’s the crux of the matter: <strong>creative faith doesn’t give up</strong>. Creative faith always finds another way. Creative faith is crazy. But it’s crazy because there are so few of us who are there. Yet, we could be there. Very simply could we fight today to take that first step. Today could be the day you venture toward a faith that no longer knows failure and defeat. Today could be the day where you begin to climb up the roof, because Jesus and being near to Him is just that important.</p>

            <p>In all honesty, I don’t like having to say, “I’m sorry,” because I know that what I’m really saying is that I screwed up and I was wrong. It’s those last three words that cut me deeply, leaving me far too vulnerable. Sure, my reaction may be a little extreme, but when being right was what you grew up understanding as how people would accept you, being wrong is rather terrifying. However, this week has begun to reteach me that the life of faith, my faith isn’t about being right or wrong. Rather, life is about redemption and where we go from being wrong.</p>

<h4 id="redemption-stories">Redemption stories</h4>

<p>Look at the lives of David and Peter. The great King David, through whom Jesus proudly traced His lineage, was a mess. David had a man killed, a man very important to him, just so David could sleep with this man’s wife. Yet, David was redeemed; David was counted a good king. Peter, brash Peter, denied Jesus three times. Peter denied Jesus three times in one night. Yet, redemption is the best word to describe the upswing that led to this disciple who founded the Church. Redemption is the only thing that could have enabled such a drastic one-eighty.</p>

<h4 id="living-the-redemption-story">Living the redemption story</h4>

<p>Jesus came, died, and resurrected for every transgression, shortcoming, failure. For every sin, Jesus bought the sinner’s redemption. Once and for always, we are redeemed. It is a costly redemption, as Jesus, God Himself, had to die. However, it is a permanent one, lasting even through death. For the damaged relationship with our Father we mourn. But, it is for the hope in the promise of Jesus that we have joy. In the depths, there is still the light of the redemption He bought for us. And it’s that light I hope for us to focus on today, friends.</p>

<p>The Bible is one large redemption narrative, but that should tell us that God is a God of redemption. Since Adam and Eve, He has been weaving together the most elaborate redemption story ever told. I think we can all agree that this world could use some redeeming. And I doubt any of us would argue that we individually need some redeeming, as well. If you look, you’ll find the redemption story unwinding in your own life, friend. For that, I rejoice. For the story I see unfolding in my own life, I am grateful. Because a world viewed through the lens of redemption is an infinitely beautiful one, the ultimate masterpiece in progress.</p>

          <h2><a href="/starving-the-soul-better-late-than-never/">starving the soul (better late than never)</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>I’ll admit to y’all, I often feel too busy for God. I often forget to stop and spend some alone time with my Father. And the busier I am, the easier it is to perpetuate the starving of my soul. The easier it is to think that I’ve been going it alone and that I can continue without His help, His love. Friends, a man who doesn’t spend time contemplating God’s love, experiencing it in the quiet of his own heart, is little more than the animals. So, pardon me that this post is a day late. I couldn’t rightly post without taking a few moments in contemplative prayer yesterday.</p>

<h4 id="food-to-the-starvingsoul">Food to the starving soul</h4>

<p>I think most of you know that God is our soul’s daily sustenance. For those of you that know, I couldn’t be more glad. To those that don’t, I speak to you. Have you ever experienced God filling your soul? Have you ever experienced that kind of fulfillment and satisfaction, even though fleeting? Wouldn’t you like that again? IF you haven’t experienced this, wouldn’t you like to feel contentment deep within? Shouldn’t we all ascribe to feeling content to our very cores? Isn’t that the bliss of the soul? Isn’t that nirvana?</p>

<h4 id="starving-because-were-too-busy-piggingout">Starving because we’re too busy pigging out</h4>

<p>The times when I ignore God are the times when I’m too busy settling for spiritual junk food. Spiritual analogy aside, I’m talking about substituting lust, greed, and pleasure for lasting joy. When I value objects and experiences more than God, I am denying my soul the very life force for which it craves and needs. And I’m in the midst of realizing this anew.</p>

<p>I’m keeping this short, because there’s no need to complicate what I’m learning, friends: God is what feeds my soul. When I forget Him, I neglect my starving heart and only starve it further. I need God, not because my parents or my church tell me so, but because I know it in my core. Do you know this, friend? Are you currently starving your soul like me? Have you ever really felt a soul content with the God you were feeding it?</p>

          <h2><a href="/grace-and-my-desperate-need-for-it/">grace and my desperate need for it</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>It’s hard running a small blog. I’d imagine it’s harder than running a large one. Why? Because I don’t get a whole lot of feedback and so even when I feel like my words aren’t being received well, it’s hard to pinpoint what’s causing the negative reaction.</p>

<p>Talking about my audience, you, isn’t why I’m here, though. I only use that to say I hope I don’t come off as less in need of grace than anyone else. Why is this important right now? Well, I was reading more in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Ragamuffin-Gospel-Bedraggled-Beat-Up/dp/1590525027/ref=pd_sim_b_1/182-8096308-2219225"><em>The Ragamuffin Gospel</em></a> by Brennan Manning and it brought the need for grace directly to my attention. See, needing grace less would mean that I have something else to rely on, and, you see, I have nothing else. Nothing. Grace is all I’ve really got going for me. And that’s the way it should be.</p>

<h4 id="grace-embracesflaws">Grace embraces flaws</h4>

<p>See, the grace of God isn’t His ignoring our flaws and shortcomings. No, it’s His deep recognition of each and every one of them and embracing them all. He loves me <em>with</em> every blemish and imperfection, not <em>in spite of</em> them. And therein lies the crucial distinction.</p>

<h4 id="grace-depends-on-nothingelse">Grace depends on nothing else</h4>

<p>God loves me because He is good and gracious. There is nothing that I have, nothing that I’ve done, nothing that I am that could ever earn His love and favor. And there is nothing that ever could.</p>

<h4 id="the-relief-ofgrace">The relief of grace</h4>

<p>This is the relief of grace. There is nothing I need to do. There is nothing I need to be. There is <em>nothing</em>. Nothing I need to earn or maintain. I am simply free to be. I am enough in who He has made me. And that is good enough for Him. <strong>I am good enough for Him.</strong> And so are you.</p>

<p>Thinking into grace is a scary thing. It forces us to shed our performance mindset and cast aside our Facebook-selves. It burns to rubble all our feats, trophies, efforts, and accomplishments and lays us bare. Yet, it is this nakedness that God, in His infinite grace, <em>loves</em>. It is because of His grace that He loves. <strong>And we are merely free to be the very picture of imperfection we are today. Because that imperfection is enough for Him.</strong> Who else can tell us otherwise?</p>

<h4 id="free-in-the-economy-ofgrace">Free in the economy of grace</h4>

<p>Grace is extended freely to all who ask it of God. Two millennia ago, God secured the future of grace when He sent His Son to the cross and Jesus rose forever from the dead. I won’t go too deep into that theologically, but Jesus’ death and resurrection forever cemented the availability of grace to all. Jesus became in a sense the love letter attached to the basket of grace left at the sinner’s doorstep on a cold, ravaging night just in time to provide needed sustenance to the starving. But there is no price tag attached or address for recompense. No, it is grace, it is a gift.</p>

<h4 id="cheap-in-the-economy-ofgrace">Cheap in the economy of grace</h4>

<p>Just because grace is free, doesn’t mean it didn’t come at great cost. God had to offer up His Son’s life to pay for our grace. In the economy of grace, the priceless is given away freely. What we could not hope to ever earn was hand delivered to our souls. What we needed now just as much as we need it today was brought straight to us. It found many of us almost before we knew we needed it.</p>

<h4 id="cheapening-the-economy-ofgrace">Cheapening the economy of grace</h4>

<p>We cheapen the economy of grace when we take grace for granted. When we break God’s heart like there is no tomorrow, only to wake up the next morning to do it all over again, claiming we are forgiven, this is cheapening God’s economy. This licentiousness is the very antithesis of the economy of grace. Though grace came freely, again, it did not come without cost. Just the opposite, grace was very costly. Grace was costly as could be.</p>

<h4 id="offerings-in-the-economy-ofgrace">Offerings in the economy of grace</h4>

<p>While grace is offered freely, it is by no means free. In the economy of grace, there is but one way to give thanks for the gift of grace and it is a lifelong pursuit. We give thanks by living a life loving God and sharing the grace given to us with those around us, family, friends, loved ones, strangers. Yes, the offer is free, but accepting it means giving up your life, friend. Accepting grace means trading life as lasting as a flash of lightning for eternity. But it will most certainly cost you your life.</p>

<p>The economy of grace tells us that our economies of karma and relationship have it all wrong. The economy of grace says that I will give you what cost me dearly, asking nothing in return. Expecting nothing, I give you my most valuable possession. We are free to accept or decline the offer, but accepting will forever change us. Accepting grace sets us on a course that slowly seeks to better understand the value of what we have received and how thankful we really are for being able to receive that gift. Let’s value grace today, friends. Dearly.</p>

          <h2><a href="/doubt-for-the-hopeful/">doubt for the hopeful</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>I think we all agree that doubt is an inevitable occurrence in life. We all have had those moments when our faith seemed to fail us, when God’s grace seemed a distant memory. Despite the fact that we all go through this, why is it so crippling each time?</p>

<h4 id="lingering-doubt">Lingering doubt</h4>

<p>I know that I’ve discussed my doubt of the limits of God’s love, but I’ll tell you that doesn’t make it any easier. I screw up, I sin, <em>often</em>. Mind you, most all of it would be considered minor, but sin is still sin. And each time, a little part of me waits for the floor to drop, sending me plummeting into the abyss. Dramatic, yes, but you get my point.</p>

<h4 id="doubt-that-cutsdeeply">Doubt that cuts deeply</h4>

<p>Most often, it’s not the petty aspects of our faith that we doubt. Most of the time, it isn’t a question over whether Jesus rose on the third day or after the third day. No, the doubt cuts far deeper and casts doubt on our very identity in Christ. It’s normally something we hold very near and dear to our hearts, and that’s what hurts. In fact, we often feel guilty for doubting such “forgone conclusions”. But the doubts are very real.</p>

<h4 id="doubt-likethomas">Doubt like Thomas</h4>

<p>I like to make fun of poor Thomas. You remember, the guy who said he needed to see the risen Jesus to believe? Yeah, and he’s been the butt of jokes and ridicule ever since. Yet, I doubt like him so often. God will answer my prayer and I will instead of believing He’s answered ask Him to show me. And this unbelief, this “show me” attitude makes doubt more complicated.</p>

<h4 id="doubt-midst-thehope">Doubt midst the hope</h4>

<p>When we doubt, rarely is it because we don’t wish to believe. No, it’s usually the opposite. We would give anything to believe, but we simply can’t. And this seems to hint at the point of doubt. This gets at the very crux of doubt.</p>

<h4 id="the-cure-fordoubt">The cure for doubt</h4>

<p>You think I’m going to say Jesus, don’t you? Well, you’re right. But hold on. Doubt is something that our hope alone isn’t strong enough to overcome. We need help. We need something greater than ourselves to overcome, well, ourselves. And this is precisely where Jesus enters the scene. This is exactly where the words of Jesus speak healing over our aching hearts. This is what He says to me:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I have said these things to you, that in me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation. But take heart; I have overcome the world.” — <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john%2016:33&amp;version=ESV">John 16:33</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Doubt is inevitable and it can be disabling. Though we may feel ashamed or silly, our doubt is very real and it’s entirely personal. However, though it may last for awhile, there is hope. There is healing found in no place other than the very source of our faith. We must return to the words of God and ask Him to water those seeds, that they would take root in due time. Though the healing waits, it will not tarry, because He promises it won’t. Stay strong today, friends, and doubt on.</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <blockquote>
  <p>“Brothers, if anyone is caught in any transgression, you who are spiritual should restore him in a spirit of gentleness. Keep watch on yourself, lest you too be tempted.” — <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%206:1&amp;version=ESV">Galatians 6:1</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It was a pleasure getting to church yesterday morning to find out the pastor of the church I attended back in college was delivering the message Sunday. It was even more enjoyable that the passage he focused on was something that’s been rattling around my brain and sprinkled through some recent conversations. So, today I will have to let you in on some of my thoughts about transgression and the Christian’s responsibility to speak to them, or against them, and how.</p>

<h4 id="transgressions-ofanyone">Transgressions of anyone</h4>

<p>“If <em>anyone</em> is caught in <em>any</em> transgression” is rather all-encompassing. There are no ‘if’s ‘but’s or ‘or’s, please make no mistake. There is no gray area left to the imagination or interpretation. These are the specifics and the generalities with which we’re dealing. There is no mention of ethnicity, gender, religion, sexual orientation, nothing. The concern, again, is <em>anyone</em> committing <em>any</em> transgression.</p>

<h4 id="transgression-brothers-andsisters">Transgression, brothers and sisters</h4>

<p>“Brothers, if anyone is caught in any transgression, you who are spiritual should restore him in a spirit of gentleness.” Brothers here is referring to both men and women in the Church, and “you who are spiritual” further serves to refine that definition to those who walk in and rely on the Holy Spirit. Therefore, if you believe in the Holy Spirit and follow Christ, Paul is speaking to us. He is urging us in these words to restore any and everyone in any sort of transgression. It is not our job to pass along the news down the grapevine, but to restore this person lovingly. This latter part should be redundant, though.</p>

<h4 id="transgression-in-ourresponse">Transgression in our response</h4>

<p>Two things that Paul warns us against are responding harshly to “sin” and the restorer falling to transgression, also. I like catching people in sin and blowing it out of proportion in my mind. Honestly, it makes me feel like a better Christian. It allows me to gloss over my own glaring shortcomings. I know I’m not alone in this tendency, and Paul knew this to be human tendency. First of all, we must be aware of this and resist, friends. I won’t try to put words into Paul’s mouth when it comes to the restorer transgressing, but whether it’s committing a similar sin or becoming arrogant of their “sin-busting” ability, it’s still transgression and we’re susceptible. I don’t know what works for you, but the bottom line is again, we must be constantly in check with where our heart is.</p>

<p>We’ve all committed a transgression, sin, or two. We’ve all done things we’re not proud of. However, when we see it around us, it’s up to each and everyone of us to dust off our brothers and sisters and lovingly set them back on course. We’re not called to fix, merely to care. However, the responsibility is upon us all, each one. In love, we present the truth, and in love we gently help them back up. Carefully, we extend our hands to our brothers and sisters as equals, guarding against pride which can take us all down in one fell swoop.</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <blockquote>
  <p>Then the Lord said to Moses, “Behold, I am about to rain bread from heaven for you, and the people shall go out and gather a day’s portion every day, that I may test them, whether they will walk in my law or not. On the sixth day, when they prepare what they bring in, it will be twice as much as they gather daily.” So Moses and Aaron said to all the people of Israel, “At evening you shall know that it was the Lord who brought you out of the land of Egypt, and in the morning you shall see the glory of the Lord, because he has heard your grumbling against the Lord. For what are we, that you grumble against us?” And Moses said, “When the Lord gives you in the evening meat to eat and in the morning bread to the full, because the Lord has heard your grumbling that you grumble against him — what are we? Your grumbling is not against us but against the Lord.” — <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%2016:4-8&amp;version=ESV">Exodus 16:4–8</a></p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="manna-in-themorning">Manna in the morning</h4>

<p>Does it at all strike you as odd that bread would rain down from heaven six days a week in the Sinai desert? Does it not also strike you as odd that they could only take one day’s worth of manna, except for the Sabbath? These are just the questions I think we have today. No, we’re not looking for bread to appear in the desert, but we are looking for sustenance every day. We’re looking for provision. We’re all asking, “When is it coming and will I have enough?”</p>

<h4 id="manna-in-thedesert">Manna in the desert</h4>

<p>What struck me in the car as I was pondering this <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Exodus%2016&amp;version=ESV">passage</a> on the commute is that I think God is telling us we’ll all go through the desert. Big picture, that desert will be a season that feels like an eternity and we’ll probably figure out it wouldn’t have taken so long had we been less stubborn. I digress, but in the desert, we will have only enough time to allow God to bring us where He wants us, where we’re meant to be.</p>

<h4 id="manna-in-thedesert-1">Manna in the desert?!</h4>

<p>May I reiterate my awe at bread just appearing when the Israelites awoke in the morning? Only enough manna for the day. Like this, God offers us His grace, enough for the day. In other words, His provision is sufficient for all the day may throw at us. However, in the morning, we must seek Him again. But, He will provide.</p>

<h4 id="manna-andquail">Manna and quail?!!</h4>

<p>Mark Batterson does a much better job explaining the miracle of quail in <a href="http://thecirclemaker.com/about">The Circle Maker</a>, but quail have no business anywhere near where the Israelites were, let alone feeding an entire camp of hungry Israelites <em>in the desert</em>. And it’s when we’re in the desert ourselves that God does some equally, if not more, amazing things in our lives. I think the quail was just a way of God saying He hears us, even in our grumbling, and not only will He provide, but He will do so in grand fashion.</p>

<p><strong>God provides</strong>. He provides enough grace for the day, no matter what it holds, <em>every</em> day. We will pass through the desert, and it will be tough, but He has us there for a reason. <strong>God will show up</strong>. When He shows up, He will do so spectacularly, but with restraint. He will awe and amaze us, but ultimately He wants us, daily. <strong>God wants us</strong>. He will not force Himself on us, though. <strong>Do we want Him?</strong></p>

</blockquote>

<h4 id="new-commandment">New commandment?</h4>

<p>It’s funny that Jesus calls this a new commandment. He’s not misleading us, as the words “love your neighbor” are not explicitly in the <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=exodus%2020:1-21&amp;version=ESV">Ten Commandments</a>. However, this new commandment as Jesus calls it is not at all new as it was already understood well by scholars of the time.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Jesus] said to [the lawyer], “What is written in the Law? How do you read it?” And he answered, “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind, and your neighbor as yourself.” And he said to him, “You have answered correctly; do this, and you will live.” — <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+10:26-28&amp;version=ESV">Luke 10:26–28</a></p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="still-missing-how-this-is-a-new-commandment">Still missing how this is a new commandment</h4>

<p>So why does Jesus call loving our neighbors, loving others, a new commandment? What is the reason for this redundancy? After a weekend of housewarming parties, out-of-town guests, making new friends and enjoying old friends, I realize loving people isn’t easy. In fact, it’s the toughest, most straightforward thing I believe we can do on this earth. You might argue it’s loving God, but for the sake of argument, let’s say it’s people for now. It’s not because people are evil, stubborn, mean, or anything like that. No, it’s because I myself am imperfect. It’s because loving others, this new commandment, is important enough that I need to be constantly reminded to get out of my own way. Daily, multiple times a day, I need to remember to leave my pride at the door, so that I can be able to love those around me.</p>

<h4 id="the-new-commandment-that-isntnew">The new commandment that isn’t new</h4>

<p>The new commandment is just that important. Jesus knew that. It’s I who has a hard time understanding His foresight. But, I type as if I should be surprised by this. The fact is that Jesus issued this new command right in front of the people who knew Him most intimately on this earth. I have to believe that Jesus knew even these, the ones who would understand Him the best needed this reminder as well. And it wasn’t just any reminder, but it was a very strong one at that. What should that say to us, then?</p>

<p>Before launching into one of the greatest expositions on love (see John 14 and 15), Jesus issued a new commandment for all to hear, that we are to love one another just as He had loved. These are strong words for a man who issued few directives. However, we cannot ignore the levity which He bestowed on this single phrase. We cannot continue to overlook the daily significance these words, this new commandment must have for us all. We cannot proceed loving ignorantly, as ignorance is no means of innocence. But in the end, we will find satisfaction and fulfillment like none other. Are you ready for that, friend?</p>

          <h2><a href="/the-sound-of-silence-to-a-racing-heart/">the sound of silence to a racing heart</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>I will fully admit that I love the Civil Wars. The band, that is, not any armed conflict that may have come to mind. Anyway, I was listening to their new album and the song <a href="http://vevo.ly/3hcGdR">“Same Old Same Old”</a> played on the way to work. I couldn’t help but to note the tension created by the lyrics and the sparse arrangement that sandwich the song. And like a true writer, I was off and mind racing about how silences in our spiritual lives create tension when we’re hurting or waiting and looking for God to speak in the midst of the confusion.</p>

<h4 id="silence-like-ahammer">Silence like a hammer</h4>

<p>Silence, I’ll admit, can feel like the hammer coldly driving the last nail into the proverbial coffin. Those times when we’re begging God for an answer, a response, every moment can feel like that of an astronaut without a spacesuit. When I’m waiting on God, I wanted my answer yesterday, so I’m obviously impatient that I’ve been inconvenienced into today. But I am missing something, and my fear in the silence tries to tell me that what I’m missing is inconsequential. The fact is, what I’m missing, really ignoring, makes an eternity of difference.</p>

<h4 id="silence-like-adrought">Silence like a drought</h4>

<p>Oftentimes, it’s the silence that leads to my growth. It’s the moment when I stop flailing around like a drunken whirling dervish, that I am able to sit in the silence for just a moment and see more clearly. You see, the silence isn’t a punishment. If anything, the silence God means to make us hardier like a short drought. Sure, we may start to wither, but the rains will come. God will speak once more. The drought isn’t a great analogy, but rain aside, God gives us silence so that we have a chance to slow down, think, and breathe more deeply. And then the rains come.</p>

<h4 id="silence-before-thestorm">Silence before the storm</h4>

<p>God seems most silent right before He is about to share with us something big. I had that experience last week. Honestly, it was a struggle and I felt a little cut off from His love. Toward the end of the week, I stopped frantically running around and tried to content myself with the silence. Come Sunday, there was a peace like none other and a revelation about Him that shook my worldview to the core. Normally, this latter fact would be detrimental, but with the peace came solid ground for my feet, so my shaken worldview did not leave me without something to stand on as I’ve experienced before. And right before my old foothold crumbled away, He showed me one that would take me higher and leave me more secure. This is how God works.</p>

<p>I hate silence most of the time. Our world is not comfortable with silence. But that is another conversation. Silence makes us uncomfortable and we grow uncertain as we can no longer hear the God we cannot see or touch. Days pass and we feel He has forsaken us, left us for dead. But, when we recognize these lies for what they are, we see God has given the gift of silence to allow for pause. And when we take the brief respite, seeking Him earnestly, we are prepared for the oncoming flood of grace. And we are once again overwhelmed by the love that knows no bounds, that heals all. It’s for this He’s preparing our hearts, but that takes silence.</p>

          <h2><a href="/god-is-good-doesnt-mean-happiness/">god is good doesn’t mean happiness</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>It was the moment I plopped myself into the armchair, surrounded by about ten friends and a couple spouses, that I realized the magnitude of what I was about to do. The last to go, I had taken for granted their honesty in sharing with the group where they were in life and for what they needed prayer. Now, it was my turn and I was about to lose it. What do I talk about? How much is too much? How much grief can I share before I become the self-pitying sob story? I know, I’m getting to the point. As I sit here reflecting on those moments, what I did share and the rest of the weekend, I understand something very important just a little bit better. That is that God is good and He is in control. No, that control hasn’t led me at all where I wanted, planned, and schemed, but it has led me to a place right now that is best for me and I will only continue to see that more as the days pass. But what is <em>good</em>?</p>

<h4 id="good-in-the-land-of-happiness">Good in the land of happiness</h4>

<p>Unfortunately, good doesn’t translate well in the land of pleasure seekers. Good, I find myself often using as a synonym for happy, but this is far from the truth. Happiness says, “If you’re not having fun, then you’re doing it wrong,” while good says, “Pain may last through the night, but joy comes with the morning.” Good is not the absence of pain, but says that pain will always come with lavish reward. Good is allowing us to struggle because it is for our best. Yes, good is just that, it is our best. However, best is defined from the Omniscient standpoint, not our clouded vision in the moment.</p>

<h4 id="good-foryou">Good for you</h4>

<p>For those who love God, all things happen for good (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans%208:28&amp;version=ESV">Romans 8:28</a>). Notice it doesn’t say for <em>their</em> or <em>our</em> good, but for <em>good</em>. Why am I pointing out such a trivial matter? Because the lack of a possessive adjective means a world of difference. It means that good is good and that good is defined by a Sovereign. It means that God is good; good is defined by the One whom it describes. Therefore, our good is ultimately the good of God. Going one step further, it means that our best is subject to what God before time defined as good. <strong>And that good is what is being carried out this very moment</strong>.</p>

<h4 id="a-life-ofgood">A life of good</h4>

<p>Look at the life of Paul. I think any Christian or person familiar with the New Testament can agree that man did some good in the world. I think we can also agree that he reaped a lot of crap in return, being arrested a few times and languishing in prison a significant portion of his Christ-following days. Yet, this is good. No, spending all your days in prison isn’t itself good, but the joy and certainty those days wrought most certainly are, even today. The challenge for us is how do we reconcile this man’s life with the world and lives of people living in it nearly two millennia later?</p>

<p>As I’m learning, we can only accept good if we accept that God is for us, but He is not simply for our happiness. The truth we need to cling onto is that God is working all things for our best. Our best isn’t our happiest, but our most joyful. God is working all things so that we would understand His love, reacting with an overwhelming impulse to share that love abundantly with the world around us. It is something beyond our comprehension, because we are trying to understand something straight from the mind of the Omniscient. But He loves us fiercely and doesn’t want to cause pain or upheaval in our lives, but neither did our parents when disciplining us. All the sadness, loss, disappointment pains Him greatly, but He allows it out of love, out of trying to provide us His best, <em>the</em> best.</p>

          <h2><a href="/responsible-for-our-brothers-and-sisters/">responsible for our brothers and sisters</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>How much should I care about my friends? I don’t ask in the sense that I’m contemplating ignoring or even hating, but rather, how responsible am I as my “brother’s keeper”? Maybe this seems cut and dry to you, but please humor me in explaining to you my mental struggle. Where does my responsibility to take care of my friends and family end? Am I responsible for helping to manage their expectations when possible? Am I responsible for their thoughts toward me, their impression? Am I culpable for their actions? It sounds silly, but to the one always trying to cater to others, this is a legitimate line of questioning.</p>

<h4 id="responsible-foryourself">Responsible for yourself</h4>

<p>First and foremost, we need to take full responsibility for ourselves, our thoughts, actions, words, reactions. When it comes to these areas, there can be no gray-space. We may not be able to change directly how we think or react, but we are more than capable of managing these parts of ourselves. If we screw up, the blame is squarely on our shoulders.</p>

<h4 id="identifying-the-parties-responsible">Identifying the parties responsible</h4>

<p>What I’m learning is that being responsible doesn’t involve micromanaging those around me. Responsibility is helping them to be more responsible for themselves. Responsibility equips and empowers. Taking that too far only serves to <em>exacerbate</em> the problem. Taking responsibility too far <em>handicaps</em>.</p>

<h4 id="the-responsible-way">The responsible way</h4>

<p>By all means, love your friends and family. Love them deeply, fiercely. It’s this love that will compel you to do the best for them and nothing less. It’s out of this love that we recognize when our actions, reactions, may be hindering our loved ones. It’s out of this love that we stop trying to manage them in ways we’re only beginning to learn how to manage in ourselves. It’s out of this love that we leave behavior modification out of the equation and heart change to God. If need be, we point them toward God for a certain habit, not play god.</p>

<p>Sometimes the responsible reaction is to back off and let people take responsibility for themselves. I know I need to let this truth marinate in my heart. I know that in stepping back, but not shying away from offering help or counsel, I’m really enabling the other person to exercise self-care. In calling them equal and not placing myself above them in the relationship, you see, I’m actually loving them and ridding myself of the undue stress in the process.</p>

          <h2><a href="/i-am-waiting-on-god-in-fear/">i am waiting on god in fear</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>I’ll admit, my greatest fear is that God will one day up and leave me. I confessed this once again yesterday evening, sitting in the dining room, talking with Erik. I have this irrational and unshakable fear that my Heavenly Father, the God that is love, will finally get fed up with my screw-ups and failings and consider me a worthless cause. I’m terrified that maybe He’s not 100% love and that time spent waiting on His answers to prayers would better be spent working to provide for myself, rather than allow Him to work and eventually decide I’m not worth the provision. In my waiting, I try to prove to Him that I’m worth it, that He shouldn’t leave me high and dry. And I know I’m not alone.</p>

<h4 id="waiting-to-be-abandoned">Waiting to be abandoned</h4>

<p>If you’re anything like me, experience has taught me that at some point I will be left by those close to me. Girlfriends, friends, acquaintances, broken marriages have all served at one point or another to convince me that I’m doomed to be left alone, abandoned. And so I have an intrinsic distrust, especially on first meeting, that this is just another opportunity to be reminded that I’m just waiting for this process to take place all over again.</p>

<h4 id="waiting-to-be-appreciated">Waiting to be appreciated</h4>

<p>I try, in response, to desperately establish a basis of empathy with new acquaintances. I want to show them quickly and often that I am worthy of being kept around. And I carry this compulsion into my relationship with God. I’m constantly trying to be pious so that He won’t pull the plug on me when I really need Him. And when those times of waiting do come around, with it is the inevitable stress. What else can I do to prove to the Father that I’m worth providing for this time? And I spin my wheels in religious haste.</p>

<h4 id="waiting-on-myheart">Waiting on my heart</h4>

<p>And God patiently waits for me to exhaust myself in my outwardly “Christian” tizzy. He’s patient, loving. There is nothing more than a whispered, “Calm down, my son,” in response. Once I’m done, He calmly shows me how silly I’ve been. He gently reassures me He is there and He hears my fears. He convinces me in my heart that He will never leave me, at least not today. And He provides.</p>

<p>We’ve all had broken relationships, people leaving us, and oftentimes it can convince us that God will leave us as well. Especially in the times we have to wait for God to provide, it’s unnerving because we can’t find enough to continue proving our worth to God to fill the time. I know I freak out in these times, but God is patient with us. He works with our fear and calmly reassures us He is going nowhere, ever. He will never leave me, nor you. He will never forsake us. In fact, He loves us and is for us, always.</p>

          <h2><a href="/a-gift-is-what-you-make-of-it/">a gift is what you make of it</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>If I’m honest, I’ve been given a lot in my life. A lot is even a gross understatement, but that’s beside the point. You know what gift out of all of them I treasure most? It’s relationships. For those of you who don’t know me or know me well, relational strife will ruin my day. Actually, relationships have ruined weeks on end for me. I value them more than gold. Actually, it’s unhealthy the value I place on relationships. What’s particularly unhealthy, I realize, is the fact that I chronically forget to stop and thank the giver of my relationships. And that’s really the problem: <strong>I value the gift more than the Giver</strong>.</p>

<h4 id="plethora-ofgifts">Plethora of gifts</h4>

<p>There are so many things we’ve been given. Using my life as an example, I have family, friends, a house, a church, a job, a car, etc. These are just the big-ticket items and there are too many to mention. I’ll admit, it’s far too easy to become complacent and take for granted that the gifts will keep coming without end. It’s easy to preoccupy ourselves with the latest gift of a promotion, or a new significant other and forget about the Father who lovingly doted the gift on us in the first place. <em>It’s easy to become a selfish brat</em>.</p>

<h4 id="thankful-for-the-realgift">Thankful for the real gift</h4>

<p>Being thankful for each new gift is a cultivated skill. Resisting complacency is a matter of perspective. See, what I’m learning is that each gift, no matter how shiny, neat, or cool, is but a foretaste of what’s to come. Each gift is but a drop in the bucket of what God will give to us soon enough. Each gift is really nothing more than a tangible reminder that our Father loves us deeply and wants to give us a better idea of that love. Yet, I so often miss the forest for the trees and content myself playing with the box when there’s a brand new fire truck sitting there in front of me.</p>

<h4 id="were-not-ready-for-the-realgift">We’re not ready for the real gift</h4>

<p>In my response to each gift, I show God that I’m not ready for the real gift. What is that? Why, it’s God Himself. The ultimate present God could ever give is His attention and time. No, I merely settle for the twenty-dollar bill I found in my pocket the other day. I’m far from ready for an eternity with the only being that <em>is</em> Love. I’m not ready for the everlasting warmth and joy of His embrace. <strong>I’m too busy playing with my tinker toys</strong>.</p>

<p>This may seem an odd question, but I sometimes wonder if I’ve been given too much. I wonder if God gave me less, would I appreciate Him more? But God, the loving Father that He is, knows exactly how much He can “spoil” us. He knows what is just enough, but this doesn’t stop me from being ungrateful. He gives so much, but ultimately the problem is I don’t understand and appreciate what He is really trying to give me. The real gift is Himself, His time and affection, but I don’t have the perspective, not yet. I’m not ready to fully appreciate all He has to give. Truthfully, the gift of God would overwhelm me mightily and I’d only squander it. But that has to change and that change has to begin today. So you friend, what is it that you treasure more than gold, more than God?</p>

          <h2><a href="/wellness-is-not-just-a-health-issue/">wellness is not just a health issue</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>When I hear the word “wellness”, I immediately think of health and doctors and sterile offices. It’s funny how seemingly innocuous words can carry with them such a strong context that they can have no other application (at least in my mind). I was fortunate enough this weekend to spend a little time with both my dad and my brother as we all caught up and talked about life and such. At one point, my dad began to talk about how the emphasis he places on his physical health and strength, as well as his emotional health, play a role in his ability to lead at work. Having read Pete Scazzero’s “Emotionally Healthy Spirituality,” I couldn’t help but to see that my dad was really referring to wellness, nor could I help but to think about its role in faith. But what am I making such a big deal about here?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And he answered, “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind, and your neighbor as yourself.” — <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+10:27&amp;version=ESV">Luke 10:27</a></p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="wellness-was-big-tojesus">Wellness was big to Jesus</h4>

<p>THe words above are the words of a young lawyer answering Jesus how he read the Word of God. You see, loving God is a holistic act, encompassing mind, body, and spirit. It requires each to be fit, ready to perform at its peak to worship best our awesome Father.</p>

<h4 id="physical-wellness-is-togive">Physical wellness is to give</h4>

<p>The fact is, if the body is not fit, then we’re not able to give our all to God. Plain and simple, we’re not fit, so our ability, dare I say, our performance will suffer. And we are under no compulsion to perform for God, but a life of loving Him will inherently manifest itself in a life of serving those around us. Without physical wellness, this means diet, sleep and exercise, we are hamstringing our efforts.</p>

<h4 id="emotional-wellness-is-tolove">Emotional wellness is to love</h4>

<p>If there is a gaping hole in your heart from childhood hurts or the one that got away, then how can you love anyone, let alone God, with a whole heart? If we don’t strive after emotional wellness, we are unable to attain the core of Christianity, or really any monotheistic faith: we cannot possibly love God. It’s a simple fact, yet so many of us walk around with hearts full of emotional bomb blasts and bullet holes as if there is nothing wrong. Of course, I could just be making this up to keep you reading…</p>

<h4 id="spiritual-wellness-islife">Spiritual wellness is life</h4>

<p>Spiritual wellness is what connects us ultimately to God. If we do not at our cores recognize the fact that we desperately need God, we are dead. To the atheists out there, feel free to push back against this assertion, but Jesus is life and living without even a breath of His life-giving grace is one closer to our death. Coming to terms with the fact that on our own we are inadequate at times, incapable, unworthy even, but this is not our fate.</p>

<h4 id="wellness-isnt-all-aboutus">Wellness isn’t all about us</h4>

<p>I said that spiritual wellness is about recognizing our limitations and imperfections, but this isn’t our fate. This is because we have Jesus and the Holy Spirit making us well day by day. Ultimately, God will allow us and enable us to become spiritually well, but this wellness has to be accompanied by efforts in the other aspects of physical and emotional wellness. We have to take an earnest interest in our well-being. Again, the real work isn’t what we’re doing, that’s just the tip of the iceberg. No, the real work is heart change, but God does that literally without lifting a finger. This is our God.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I appeal to you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship. Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect. — <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans%2012:1-2&amp;version=ESV">Romans 12:1–2</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ll admit, I have some work to do physically, emotionally, spiritually, friends. In fact, I have my work cut out for me, but the work of wellness is a noble occupation, more importantly, one that requires community. And that is what I’m looking to build right now. I’ve come to the conclusion that I am broken, in need of the Physician, and in need of a good pair of crutches to help get me to Him. Along the way, hopefully I’ll be able to serve others in a similar fashion. Together, we’ll become well. Together, we’ll bask in the life of love that is wellness, worshipping with joy our Father who surpasses words and understanding. Be well, my friends.</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p>I’ll admit, I’ve been wracking my brain trying to figure out how to end this series. Nothing came to mind (well, lots, but nothing great) for the last week or so. As I was looking through the posts and their topics, the simplicity, the paramount role of Jesus, the Son of God, became painfully obvious. And therein lies my point. No talk of the essentials is complete without at least mention of The Essential. No conversation is complete without due focus on “the Author and Perfecter” of our faith. But I think many of us, myself included, have lost sight of Jesus.</p>

<h4 id="jesus-is-too-elementary">Jesus is too elementary</h4>

<p>From a young age, the Sunday-school-attending youth learns the answer to everything is “Jesus”. But, many of us become numb to the underlying truth to what we’re being taught. It’s not that Jesus is the “right” answer, but that Jesus is <em>the</em> answer to everything. As in, at the risk of falling into the Sunday school trap, every care, concern, worry, issue has resolution in the person of Jesus. It is that every burden which I’ve laid on Him and let Him have control over has become resolved. Every trial for which I’ve thought myself too weak, when I’ve asked for strength, He’s lent it to me. But, somewhere around middle school I became numb to this fact and I’m having a tough time fighting my way back.</p>

<h4 id="jesus-isnt-acrutch">Jesus isn’t a crutch</h4>

<p>If religion is the opiate of the masses, then consider me addicted, but please can we not call Jesus a crutch? Community, if anything, is our crutch; <strong>Jesus is salvation</strong>. Literally, Jesus saved my life coming into college. There was a very dark night a few weeks before my freshman year where ending my life didn’t seem all that drastic. However, that was the night I decided to try out going to a college ministry, you know, the whole <em>religion thing</em>. I went to the first meeting of the year and didn’t leave but four years later. Deeper still, I know that my shortcomings have moved me further from God and there are no amounts of good deeds I could do to earn back His favor; there is no amount of goodness I could amass that would ultimately end up in my going to heaven. <strong>No, I need something far more valuable than a life marred in pride and imperfection.</strong></p>

<h4 id="jesus-islife">Jesus is life</h4>

<p>What do these crazy words mean and why do Christians keep spouting them?! If we’re to believe that God is perfect and Life itself (as its Originator) and that anything that falls short of Him is simply imperfect and at least not fully life, then we have to imagine that there is some element of death in our very bones. We have to imagine that at least some of us, some of our very core will cease to exist given this current state. What if God really loved us so much that He’d do anything within His power to give us the option not to die? What if God actually loved our souls so much that He gave a sacrifice that would even please His perfect Self and allow us to experience Him for all of eternity? Friends, this is the gravity of Jesus. This is the moment to step back and soak in all the glory of God and His immense love. This is when we fall in love with Jesus, as He’s loved us so dearly that He would willingly be our sacrifice.</p>

<p>Jesus should blow us away. Fully man, fully God aside, the person of Jesus should cause our brains to throb at the thought of His love and goodness. The quintessential nature of Jesus to our everyday being, livelihood and individual breath should be on our minds constantly. We should read about Him, contemplate Him, love Him, share Him, and enjoy His presence as He is more valuable than all the world. He is the reason the world is still turning, but somewhere along the way, our little worlds get jilted off their axes and we become off-kilter. What do you think about righting that today and asking Jesus to show you just how important He really is and always has been?</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p>The striking down of DOMA the other week in the Supreme Court is probably old news by now. I believe the issue at hand, gay marriage, is just hitting its stride. And now the Church finds itself in a highly precarious position. If gay marriage is recognized by the Supreme Court, as well as a growing number of states, how are we to react?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And he said to him, “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. This is the great and first commandment. And a second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. On these two commandments depend all the Law and the Prophets.” — Matthew 22:37–40</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="gay-marriage-doesnt-define-our-neighbors">Gay marriage doesn’t define our neighbors</h4>

<p>I’ve said this before, but the gay community is just as much our neighbors as anyone else. <em>Everyone</em> is our neighbor. Everyone. And we’re called to love them. <em>As ourselves</em>. There is no qualification here. So, first of all, we need to love those engaging in gay marriage.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“All things are lawful,” but not all things are helpful. “All things are lawful,” but not all things build up. — I Corinthians 10:23</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="gay-marriage-is-a-right-like-straightmarriage">Gay marriage is a right like straight marriage</h4>

<p>Stated the Supreme Court, gay marriage is just as legal as “traditional” marriage. Call me crazy, but in a country that touts separation of church and state, this ruling was merely a matter of time. And, from the standpoint of human Rights, it’s about time. Yes, it’s about time. On the land of freedom, gay marriage is finally recognized and the homosexual community is no longer bound to be second-class citizens.</p>

<h4 id="gay-marriage-aint-my-cup-oftea">Gay marriage ain’t my cup of tea</h4>

<p>Just because gay marriage is legal, doesn’t mean every gay Christian needs to off and get married the day their state legalizes it. Here is my caveat: we as Christians play by a different set of rules, have a separate lot in life from the rest of the world, as dictated by Christ. Therefore, we can still love our neighbors, but may have to take a second thought as to what engaging in gay marriage may speak about our following of Jesus. This, I leave up to the individual. To the leaders, homosexuals are no worse than the rest of this lying, cheating, stealing, lusting lot. They are just as deserving of love as the rest of the Body.</p>

<p>Am I crazy? Have I stepped out of line? Is gay marriage unforgivable in the Church? Do I go too far? Should homosexuals be set aside, cast aside for their sins? Are they living in any more sin than the rest of us? You tell me.</p>

            <p>If you know me, you’re probably wondering what I’m doing writing about simplicity. I have the ability to make even the minutiae seem paramount. However, once you’ve spent a few nights in your car and had to eke out a month’s mortgage with amongst creeping various other costs, you gain a little perspective. You begin to understand what really is essential and what’s extraneous. Even the boy who loves complication for complication’s sake begins to appreciate the beauty and necessity of simplicity. And I see the application to faith.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“No unbelief made [Abraham] waver concerning the promise of God, but he grew strong in his faith as he gave glory to God, fully convinced that God was able to do what he had promised. That is why his faith was ‘counted to him as righteousness.’” — Romans 4:20–22</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="faith-was-always-simplicity">Faith was always simplicity</h4>

<p>Abraham believed and it was counted to him as righteousness. That’s it. Abraham had faith, therefore he was seen as righteous before God. Faith is righteousness. Faith is salvation. There is nothing more complicated about it. And Abraham goes to show that it <em>never</em> was. Faith is pure simplicity.</p>

<h4 id="jesus-is-the-king-of-simplicity">Jesus is the king of simplicity</h4>

<p>Look at all of Jesus’ quotes in the Bible. You’ll see He didn’t answer questions with diatribes. He didn’t sit down and talk for hours on end. All but John 14–16 are answers typically a couple lines, but no more than a couple minutes of dialogue. To Simon and Andrew, He merely says, “Follow me and I’ll make you fishers of men.” (Mark 1:17) To the man who asks the greatest commandment, Jesus simply answers to love God and love your neighbor as yourself. Simplicity! There is nothing complicated, convoluted here. <em>Nothing</em>.</p>

<h4 id="we-are-simplicity-averse">We are simplicity averse</h4>

<p>Complication gives us control over the circumstances. If we can add obstacles, hoops and impediments, we make it harder on ourselves, but ultimately we know how to make it through. We create ‘if’s, ‘but’s, ‘and’s, ‘or’s, and for what? We complicate, but to what end? We convolute, but for what purpose? Even the uneducated in Jesus’ day (long before public education or widespread literacy) understood faith. It can’t be nearly as complicated as we make it today. Faith is the simplicity of believing. Faith isn’t a denomination. Faith isn’t a formula or a recipe. Faith isn’t your translation of the Bible or your devotional. It is believing with every fiber of your being. Faith is the simplicity of living in and through that belief, every breath, every thought.</p>

<p>We have taken faith and overcomplicated it, only serving to water it down. Faith today bears the same simplicity as that of Abraham and all the saints. Faith isn’t complicated. It never was and was never meant to be. However, we’ve taken it upon ourselves to complicate it, only serving to suffocate ourselves in the process. Faith is believing, nothing more. Faith is a life spent shaping, understanding, living that belief. If we want to exert our energy somewhere, it needs to be there. It needs to be faith, pure, unadulterated faith.</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p>I had every intention of writing about DOMA and the Supreme Court ruling that will forever reshape the ongoing debate on marriage. I woke up this morning collecting my thoughts and mentally putting together a post. That was until I got in the car on my way to work. Stopped at a stop light, I saw the same unemployed vet I’d seen for the past couple weeks day in, day out. But something was different about today. Something in me had changed. And so I cracked my window and held out the few lonely dollar bills I had in my wallet and my world felt a little bigger.</p>

<h4 id="just-some-one-dollarbills">Just some one dollar bills</h4>

<p>It was only four dollars. Really, I gave him nothing. It wasn’t four dollars. In fact, the money had nothing to do with it. As I drove away with tears in my eyes, I realized my world isn’t about me. Not anymore. It’s not about counting every penny, saving as much as possible in my budget to spend on furnishing my house. No, it’s about the people around me. It’s about faces and hearts of real people with real emotions, not the online shopping cart.</p>

<h4 id="dollars-tosense">Dollars to sense</h4>

<p>It took four dollars to awaken in me a little sense. That’s a cheap price to pay, but it’s been a much longer road. You see, my heart didn’t change, my world didn’t stop revolving around me <em>because</em> I gave this man a few dollar bills. No, my heart had been changed over years of experiences and little changes over time by God. Yes, I’m playing the God card. But I know that I cannot change my own heart. I know that my head is too thick for my own tactics. No, it took something more powerful to change what’s going on inside of me.</p>

<p>What brought tears to my eyes after giving that man that money was seeing and feeling the difference in my heart. It was seeing him as created by our Maker, in His image, with needs, desires, goals, and feelings. He could no longer blend into the scenery; he was no longer a street sign on the way to work. He was an appointment, a divine opportunity. I almost wasted it, but I cannot express how glad I am that I didn’t. Because it’s those insignificant moments that make a lifetime of difference. So, what chance to give a dollar or two, if you will, are you ready to waste?</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p>What does independence mean to the Christian? What does today, a primarily patriotic and nationalistic holiday, say about faith? Where is the tie-in? Where is the application?</p>

<h4 id="celebrate-independence">Celebrate independence</h4>

<p>Celebrate today, because we are free to do so. We live independent from oppression. We have independence from religious persecution. We are free to celebrate the freedom Christ’s blood purchased for us. Today should be a party. It should be raucous, it should be festive, loud and boisterous. Hallelujah, we are free! Thank you, Jesus! We have been blessed to live in a country that allows us to exercise that freedom daily! How many greater blessings are there?</p>

<h4 id="what-does-independence-mean">What does independence mean?</h4>

<p>What does independence mean for us? What is freedom? Is it just freedom <em>from</em>, or is it freedom <em>of</em>? What is the independence we celebrate today? Friend, it must be freedom of faith and freedom from faith. Our independence is one of choice. We choose to believe, but we choose knowing there must be an appropriate level of authority above us, maintaining that freedom. We are free, but at a daily cost to both God and ourselves.</p>

<h4 id="independence-tostruggle">Independence to struggle</h4>

<p>We have the freedom to ask these questions. We have the freedom to contemplate, challenge and grow through the crucible of discussions md experience. I don’t know how many more ways it can be said that we are fee, wholly, completely, totally, utterly free. That freedom was purchased long ago, but it is no less true today than yesterday, tomorrow or nearly two thousand years ago. So, why do we live like we’re shackled once more? Why do we willingly walk into the manacles of codependency and selfishness?</p>

<p>What does independence mean to you, friend? Given that meaning, how are you celebrating it today? Or have we lost the meaning along the way? Let’s rediscover it today. And let’s hold fast to that meaning. It is <em>independence</em>, after all. Live free today.</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p>I’m a sucker for coming of age movies. It’s probably because I see myself in the eventual hero, as my own coming of age wasn’t all that long ago. I threw on <em>Rushmore</em> Saturday night to unwind from the day’s excitement and found myself appreciating the film from that familiar empathy. But, what really stuck with me was the character’s failed efforts throughout the film at finding the “One” whom he thought to be a teacher at his private school. And then I proceeded to recall all my own failed attempts at pursuing the “One” and how each effort has only led to heartbreak. Then, I woke up and went to church, and that’s when the real thinking began.</p>

<h4 id="who-is-yourone">Who is your “One”?</h4>

<p>Come on, I’m sure someone comes to mind as you think through your dating past. Who is that person that would complete you, make you whole? Who was/is the person that you were able to be you around them, simply because they were himself/herself? The questions I’m asking all point to the mythical beast the “One” we’ve come to believe in like bigfoot, the tooth fairy, and (gasp!) unicorns. Maybe you gave up on them long ago, maybe you found them, or maybe you’re like me and still searching. Spoiler alert: we’ll never find them. Well, maybe you’ll find them, but that fairy tale will come crashing down faster than Chicken Little’s sky. It can’t last because no one was meant to bear that kind of burden.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“For this reason I bow my knees before the Father, from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named, that according to the riches of his glory he may grant you to be strengthened with power through his Spirit in your inner being, so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith — that you, being rooted and grounded in love, may have strength to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth, and to know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.” — <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%203:14-19&amp;version=ESV">Ephesians 3:14–19 ESV</a></p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="why-well-never-find-theone">Why we’ll never find the “One”</h4>

<p>No one can complete us. I’ve said it before, but apparently I need to hear these words again for my own edification, so please excuse me. There is no one who can complete us. There is no one on this planet who can fill us up. No, that ability and responsibility alone belongs to God. And the only way we are filled by Him is to know His love. Maybe you’re saying you don’t need God, and maybe you’re right, but there is something within you saying you need love, saying you need wholeness. I can speak for myself here. I need love. I need wholeness. While my searching has left me far off, I’ve realized that both are one and both are found in the wide open arms of my loving Father.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“So we have come to know and to believe the love that God has for us. God is love, and whoever abides in love abides in God, and God abides in him.” — <br />
<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20john%204:16&amp;version=ESV">I John 4:16</a></p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="why-well-never-need-theone">Why we’ll never need the “One”</h4>

<p>We don’t need the “One” because God <em>is</em> love. God is not just loving (thank you, Jason), but He is the embodiment of love. <strong>God is love perfected</strong>. If God is as I’m claiming here, if God is as He says He is, then what room do we have, what need do we have for the “One”? They are merely encroaching on God’s role in our lives. Really, we are covering up our God-sized hole with…well, let’s say a q-tip. I will say at this point, though, I’m not saying I have or you should give up finding love. If you’re unmarried, feeling you’re meant to be with someone, then find your love. Keep in mind that you have your Love, God, waiting patiently already to provide in the ways Hollywood has told us the “One” should.</p>

<p>Are you searching for the “One” today? Did you find them, but they turned out to just be another mortal? Are you searching for love? Have you stopped to think that maybe you’re really looking for God; that maybe all your yearning is for a Father? Well, is it? Mine is.</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p>I have some great friends. I can’t tell you how grateful I am for these people, but I know I’m not grateful enough. For encouragement, reproach, joy, sadness, community, this group of friends, is essential. The life of faith is bound to fail without community. <em>My</em> faith would have long since died without the nurturing and support of community along the way.</p>

<h4 id="college-community">College community</h4>

<p>Coming into college, my faith had no heartbeat, it was clinically dead. Those four years were some of the most crucial in forming who I am today. And I have much to owe to the group of guys with whom I trudged through life all four of those years. See, I’d wandered into Agape (Cru, a college Christian ministry) at the behest of my mother, immediately felt at home, found my way to a Bible study and spent the next four years re-learning how to live. It was these awesome men, in particular, who saw the boy afraid God might forget him become a spiritual teenager.</p>

<h4 id="philadelphia-community">Philadelphia community</h4>

<p>Community is what got me through my year outside Philadelphia. For those of you who don’t know me, I spent a year out of college interning for Cru. It was a paid internship providing tech support for the Mid Atlantic and eventually the Northeast regions. I knew no one in the area, was still rather young in my faith. During that year, I was accused of being a terrorist, spent a few nights sleeping in my car, had my heart broken, and lived barely above the poverty line. Then, there were the nights spent wrestling with my faith. I came out of that year with a few friends who are still with me today and it’s because of them I count that year as worth the price of admission. It’s scotch nights spent chewing on our faith, the up all nights reconciling haunted pasts, dashboard confessionals in company that made that year worth every minute. It’s those people that saved me that torrid year.</p>

<p>Enough about me. How about you? Where do you have community in your life? What has community helped you through? Where has it brought you and where is it taking you? Do you have enough of a community in your life, or are you struggling? Do you even know you’re struggling without it? Friend, I ask because I care about your heart. I care about showing you the greatest blessing in this life. What do you have to lose?</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p>It’s no secret that sex and sexual sin have been a thorn in the side of the Church since, well, <em>before</em> the Church. Throughout the ages, sex has pockmarked the Church’s history. And I think we can all agree that today is no different. If this is an age-old problem, then why am I talking about sex today, nearly two thousand years down the line? Because sex has been a struggle for me in the past, one which I’m still trying to fully overcome, but I’m seeing the opposite trend around me. I’m seeing a Church that is much more comfortable talking about <em>the</em> sex, but still shying away from confronting the sex lives that haunt many (certainly not all) years and years into marriage.</p>

<h4 id="instant-virtualsex">Instant virtual sex</h4>

<p>Yes, I’m talking about porn here. I’m talking about the very thing even portions of the secular world is demonizing. I’m talking about the very thing that is streaming to us faster and faster as internet speeds steadily increase. I’m talking about the fake sex we convince our minds we’re having that is ripping apart our sexual pasts and futures. But, I’m not telling you who like myself, have or do struggle with this lesser form of sexual gratification to stop. You can do whatever you like. However, you must know that it is tearing you apart every instance; it is snuffing out your future at the same time. You were meant for so much more. But, please, do what you will.</p>

<h4 id="numbing-tosex">Numbing to sex</h4>

<p>If extramarital sex isn’t happening in the church around you explicitly, then I’m just short of guaranteeing that physical intimacy boundaries are being crossed rather frequently. As a show of hands, how many of you can say without a doubt that you never crossed a line regarding sex or physical intimacy with a friend, significant other, stranger from the bar, etc.? I’ll bet that if you’re under thirty your hand is raised. Mine certainly is. The fact that I’m willing to make this claim should say something, though. Somewhere along the lines, we equated sex, or some form of physical intimacy short of sex as acceptable sin as a means of making our faith more relevant to culture. Somewhere along the lines, our faith lost its way.</p>

<h4 id="shameless-sex">Shameless sex</h4>

<p>Talk to married people and ask them about sex. Chances are, they’ll tell you “sex is great.” There is no truer answer. It’s all-encompassing, it’s honest and there are no caveats. It is the religious elite that have added the ‘but’ to that sentence. There is none. If there needs to be any more said about sex, it is that unmarried people are just not ready for it because of the spiritual, emotional and even the physical implications that sex was always meant to have. The only thing that needs to be explained is that unmarried people do not need to become one with someone who is not their soul mate. But that is another conversation. The point is: sex is great.</p>

<p>Where do we as a Church, the universal set of Bible believers, go from here? The better question is <em>how</em> do we move forward? How do we heal those broken by lesser sex, by empty porn? How do we bring to life the hearts turned to stone by repeated stimulation? How do we transition to the shameless Sex, the sex that God created for us to enjoy supremely as a show of love, worship and gratitude? I’m not sure I have the answers. But I must beg the question, sound the bell. How do we restore sex?</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p>No list of Christian essentials is complete without mentioning the recorded Word of God, itself. The irony in this post is that I realized this morning as I sat down to a quiet time, it was the first I’d had in a week. And I can feel it in my soul. The words barren, desert, dry, all came to mind as I wrote. Why? Because I hadn’t watered my faith with the perpetually thirst-quenching well of God’s word, the Bible.</p>

<h4 id="the-bible-thesource">The Bible, the source</h4>

<p>The Bible contains the very essence of the Christian faith. Without it, the essential truths, the very core of our faith would be mere wives’ tales, folklore. Without the Bible to turn back to, what leg would our faith have to stand on? Without the Bible, of what could we be certain? Or do I make too much of it?</p>

<h4 id="the-bible-informs-our-worldview">The Bible informs our worldview</h4>

<p>Our worldview needs to be shamelessly ripped from the pages of the Bible. The world around us is not to provide context for the words contained within, but rather it’s our job to influence the world around us according to the Bible. Therefore, “You shall have no other gods before me,” means that God is the one, true, all-powerful God. It doesn’t mean “I’m God, but if you want to hang out with Buddha and Krishna, that’s cool. I’ll take whatever spare time you have left over.” It doesn’t mean, “If you’re not cool with ‘religion’, that’s fine, but maybe think of me when you see Mt. Everest, or something.” No! However, these are only slight exaggerations of what mainstream society would tell us.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“How can a young man keep his way pure? By guarding it according to your word. With my whole heart I seek you; let me not wander from your commandments! I have stored up your word in my heart, that I might not sin against you.” — <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?s=O&amp;utm_expid=13466113-5&amp;search=psalm%20119:9-11&amp;version=ESV&amp;utm_referrer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.biblegateway.com%2F">Psalm 119:9–11</a></p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="the-bible-ourrock">The Bible, our rock</h4>

<p>When we are lost, down, afraid, stressed, anxious, there is always something in the Bible to bring us back to our Father. There is always something to remind us of how great our God truly is. And for those of you who question the Bible’s inerrancy, I will simply say you belittle the God of the Universe. No, the Bible isn’t a survival book broken down by every specific scenario we’ll encounter in life. However, I assure you I’ve found guidance for every scenario in which I’ve sought it.</p>

<p>The Bible, and the words contained within, form the very basis on which we’re placing our faith, but we don’t seem to care much about it. As a result, we float along, we dilute our faith and we ultimately buy and sell lies. Ashamed, I am the problem about which I complain. I, we, do not return to Truth often enough to fend off the constant deluge of lies we encounter. Each passing minute, a reassurance that we are fine on our own, without the Bible. When was the last time you opened yours? For me, it was this morning, but before that was a week ago. This cannot be. We cannot allow our faith to float aimlessly. Life is too short. And our purpose is too great. <strong>Read your Bible. Live your purpose.</strong></p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p>It struck me yesterday sitting in church that the last few weeks spent waiting, working on the house have been nothing short of a gift. I can honestly say that the time spent with him working on tearing down a wall, rewiring the electricity, painting has shown me more about my father than years of living with him. And I realized that because I hadn’t spent this time with him before, I’ve severely misunderstood him and underappreciated him. It’s because I didn’t take the time to roll up my sleeves with him, getting covered from head to toe in sweat, dust, dirt, grime, etc. that I wasn’t able to see him at his core. And the same can be applied to my heavenly Father.</p>

<h4 id="a-great-man-myfather">A great man, my father</h4>

<p>I won’t tell you, “My father’s the best!” or, “I have the greatest dad in the world!” but I will not shy away from saying that he is a great man. And I wish that I had only been a better son and student of manhood up to this point. There are life lessons he’s taught me that I will never forget, and it’s because of him I view no task as too big (other than gutting a bathroom). I cannot express to you how fortunate that he is still around and cares to teach me today. While I’m grateful, <strong>I’m afraid I may not fully understand the value of this gift until it is gone</strong>.</p>

<h4 id="a-father-to-light-theway">A father to light the way</h4>

<p>Is not our Father teaching us things about life, love, faith, etc.? In much the same way, isn’t He fathering us? Isn’t He trying to teach us His experience, His wisdom? Is He not encouraging us to join Him in a little work? But it’s hard and life is tough enough as it is. We don’t need to go on making it harder than it already is. Even still, <strong>He beckons us to join Him</strong>.</p>

<h4 id="a-fatherswisdom">A Father’s wisdom</h4>

<p>When we roll up our sleeves and go to work beside our Father, He lets us in a little closer and we are better able to see His heart. We are able to see better how deeply He cares for us and how He is trying to teach us something every step of the way. Not only is He teaching, but He is patient, loving, gentle. He knows we will make mistakes, He knows we will get frustrated, discouraged. Our Father works with us, reassuring us every step along the way. <strong>We find that our Father is good</strong>.</p>

<p>While I speak of my growing understanding and appreciation of my father, there have been people placed in our lives from whom we’re meant to learn. There are people we need to roll up our sleeves next to and do the dirty, unglamorous work of life. Similarly, we need to do this with God, our Father, as well. In the process, we learn about their heart, we enjoy and we glean from their wisdom and experience. This is how we live life. This is how we live faith. This is how we give and receive love. Most importantly, this is how we see God is good.</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p>Yes, I realize we are done with Easter. I realize we passed the Christian holiday that focuses on death. OK, so it doesn’t totally, but death is a major part of Easter. Why do I need to talk about such a gloomy topic, especially on a day where thunderstorms are racing across the east coast? Well, because faith is ultimately about experiencing life, however without death, we cannot have any part in Life.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we shall certainly be united with him in a resurrection like his. We know that our old self was crucified with him in order that the body of sin might be brought to nothing, so that we would no longer be enslaved to sin.” — <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans%206:5-6&amp;version=ESV">Romans 6:5–6</a></p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="there-will-bedeath">There will be death</h4>

<p>We were born into imperfection and there is no way to take part in perfection unless that imperfection is put to death. The imperfection to which I’m referring is the part of our human nature that forsakes future joy for present amusement. The death, if we are continuously moving forward in a relationship with our Savior, is part and parcel with the undertaking. It is only necessary. However, it is just that: <em>death</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Therefore, as one trespass led to condemnation for all men, so one act of righteousness leads to justification and life for all men. For as by the one man’s disobedience the many were made sinners, so by the one man’s obedience the many will be made righteous. Now the law came in to increase the trespass, but where sin increased, grace abounded all the more, so that, as sin reigned in death, grace also might reign through righteousness leading to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.” — <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%205:18-21&amp;version=ESV">Romans 5:18–21</a></p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="death-is-in-ourblood">Death is in our blood</h4>

<p>Maybe you do, maybe you don’t believe in Original Sin. Frankly, that’s not my concern. However, I think any follower of Christ would note their tendencies to do the opposite oftentimes of what Jesus advised. OK, maybe that’s just me, but this tendency I’ve come to know as death. If Jesus is life, then the opposite must be death. And it’s this death that we need to put to death. It is death that we need to bury six feet under the ground. Because life has been waiting ever since it arose from the tomb.</p>

<h4 id="life-afterdeath">Life after death</h4>

<p>After death, we only have life to look forward to, friends. After death, all things are new, all things bright. I’m not promising there won’t be difficulty, oh there will be immense difficulty, but it will be a struggle because of our newfound freedom, not <em>for</em> it. Life after death is all the sweeter as we’ve tasted the bitterness and are able to appreciate life all the more. It’s because of the darkness of death that we have some perception the light of life. So, there must be death.</p>

<p>Ultimately, our goal is to experience life, but first we need death. We need it to purge us of that which holds us down, causes us to follow wayward paths all too often. We were made for more, so we must shed in some way the lesser. It is a struggle; it is painful. However, the reward is more than worth the sacrifice. Life is worth the cost and more. But, I can’t convince you on my own. You have to experience it for yourself. What do you say? Is there something you’re ready to let go of today? Is there something you’re ready to put to death this moment? I challenge you. What do you have to lose? Better yet, think of all you have to gain.</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p>Whether directly or indirectly, there’s been a lot of talk of vines in my life this past weekend. Between the photo I took of the setting of my Saturday evening jam session, the tweet quoted above and a long conversation with Erik Sunday night, my weekend centered around vines, or <em>a</em> vine, in particular. I know I might’ve lost you on that last one, but bear with this vine-speak, please.</p>

<h4 id="the-thought-of-thevine">The thought of the vine</h4>

<p>The vine to which I’m referring is Jesus. He literally calls Himself the vine in <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john%2015:1-17&amp;version=ESV">John 15</a>. It is this vine that provides the very source of life for the Christian. It is this vine that we leaves cleave to for life. But, we’ve lost this fact somewhere along the way. It is the vine that directs us, feeds us; He is our originator and sustainer of life. It’s easy to take this for granted with someone so steadfast, so consistent. It’s easy to stray.</p>

<h4 id="the-vine-conversation-thatwasnt">The vine conversation that wasn’t</h4>

<p>Last night, Erik and I talked for awhile about a major way I feel the Church has strayed from the vine, from its source of life. Yep, we talked about sexual purity and how many of us are not taking nutrients from the vine in following the advice clearly laid out in this area, but instead are trying to somehow make our Christianity more salient by sufficing for less than what we know is right, know is best. I won’t go on any further about this topic, but I’ll reiterate, we’re straying from the vine, but what’s frightening isn’t the what, but the why.</p>

<h4 id="why-thevine">Why the vine?</h4>

<p>I think this is the question many millennials are asking today, just not in so many words. We’ve seen marriages, families rise and come crashing down, lives ruined and hatred all coming from Jesus-touting individuals. Most of these people have been normal, God-fearing individuals, some radicals. But, the fact of the matter is that Christianity hasn’t had a great track record as of late. Couple that with a growing distrust of institution we learned from our parents and disenfranchisement and Jesus is a tough sell these days. Who wants eternity when it’s so far away and today is right out in front of us? Who cares about tomorrow’s consequences today? Because eternity begins today and those consequences, as Mr. Driscoll noted, are today, however slight. Because Judas wasn’t broken in a day, but broken down over a series of poor decisions. We’re just too blind and calloused to see.</p>

<p>In a very real sense, Jesus is the vine that supplies our souls with the very life we Christians come to take for granted. But, because He will never forsake us, we stray. We forget we need Him and He lets us go for a while. He doesn’t write us off, but He knows we will return to Him once we’re face-to-face with our dire consequences. Sadly, for many of us, it takes losing our livelihoods, our families, our joy before we’re willing to open our eyes and look Consequence in the face. Sadly, we think we can make a go of it on our own, so our true friendships, our Bibles, collect dust while we think we’re living it up (YOLO, after all). However, we’re missing the point and slowly dying in the process. Friends, let’s take an honest look today and start off this week getting back on track to where we were when we first found our joy.</p>

          <h2><a href="/essentials-of-faith-sacrifice/">essentials of faith: sacrifice</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>This is already shaping up to be an interesting month. In essence, this week alone, my move-in date has been pushed back not once, but twice, I’ve had to find out the hard way that electricity had stopped being delivered to the house for a short period of time, financially I’m strapped, and I still have no roommate. I think it goes without saying, I did not sleep well last night. In spite of all this, I am just as certain, if not more so, that these are small sacrifices along the way to living purposefully. I know this uncertainty is necessary in forging my faith.</p>

<h4 id="sacrifice-is-uncomfortable">Sacrifice is uncomfortable</h4>

<p>As we’re all aware, sacrifice isn’t exactly pleasant. I realize, the sacrifices I’m making in owning a home are small, but they’re big enough for me right now. That’s the thing about sacrifice. There is none too big or too small. We each must sacrifice an amount that is appropriate for our faith in the time being. For some, maybe it’s giving up one Saturday a month. For others, it may be sacrificing the second latte or cappuccino of the day. For others, it may be throwing away a promising, high-profile career to uproot and start from nothing. Each is big in its own way for the right person. Each will bring us closer to our Provider.</p>

<h4 id="sacrifice-willkill">Sacrifice will kill</h4>

<p>We’ve all heard that Christians become new creations, but this rebirth is not without death. And sacrifice is the act of cutting off the air to the parts of us that must die in order for us to be remade, move forward. I don’t want to go too far into this topic, but the essence of sacrifice is choosing not to feed habits or compulsions that we hold dearly. Over time, they atrophy and dull; eventually, they die. In their place, there is not left a gaping hole, but newness.</p>

<h4 id="we-need-sacrifice">We need sacrifice</h4>

<p>Sacrifice is a broad term, but without it, our faith is left largely untested. Without sacrifice, rejecting the comfortable routine, what would force us to lean more heavily on our Father? What would give us reason to open our eyes to the infinite support He’s been offering all along? No, it’s sacrifice that shows us how He’s been providing since before the earth. It brings us ever closer to the God who loves us, and we love in return. Sacrifice isn’t a curse, but a blessing. It’s a glorious opportunity to be ushered in closer.</p>

<p>Sacrifice is not just inevitable, but it’s critical to faith. Sure, it’s uncomfortable. Sure, sacrifice hurts and works to kill off certain parts of us. But, sacrifice also nurtures and facilitates our necessary rebirth. It empties us of the hollow comforts and dependencies onto which we desperately cling. However, it simultaneously fills us with the lasting knowledge and sufficiency of God, our Father. Sacrifice merely removes the obstacles that stand in the way of our moving closer to God. Being as good as I know Him to be, this is no chore. Sacrifice is one of the greatest blessings we’re offered under the sun. So what’s your sacrifice today?</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p>&lt;</p>

<p>Hi, friends. I hope y’all had a great weekend. I know I did, but I could use a rest from my weekend. My dad and I spent the entirety of Saturday and Sunday remodeling my kitchen. If you’ve never remodeled a seventy-plus year old house that’s been remodeled a time or two before, you have no idea how much “fun” that can be. To give you an idea, it took us two whole days just to tear down a wall and patch the hole that it left in the wall and ceiling. I was completely in over my head. This is why the greatest tool I had was my dad. This was not his first rodeo and I could not be more thankful for that fact. Without him, there’s no way that could’ve happened.</p>

<h4 id="giving-my-voice-arest">Giving my voice a rest</h4>

<p>It’s because of my weekend, that I come to you today and I don’t want to talk about myself. I’m tired. I’m emotionally drained (because it’s my house and I’m working with family). Mentally, I want a vacation. I feel tattered and worn this Monday morning, but I am OK. I feel spent, but I know God has my full attention. I have nothing to give today, but I will give all to be as close to Him as possible. I need rest in His presence.</p>

<h4 id="got-rest">Got rest?</h4>

<p>What about you, friend? How rested do you feel today? Could you use a day of rest to recover from your weekend? Are you raring to go for another exciting week? I’m genuinely interested to hear. What tires you? What provides rest? Do you often get enough rest? Do you even know what rest feels like in the first place? Maybe the better question to ask is do we need rest at all? Tell me.</p>

<p>After this weekend, I’m convinced of our need for rest, friends. I’m spent, frayed and torn, but evermore convinced of my need to rely on my Father, my Sustenance. But, this post is about you, friend. Are you rested? Are you in need of a vacation after your weekly two-day? What makes you feel rested? Is rest necessary at all? I await your comments. I look forward to your input. Happy Monday, my fellow journeyers.</p>

          <h2><a href="/essentials-of-faith-purpose/">essentials of faith: purpose</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>I was having a conversation with someone the other week and we were briefly catching up. I was telling them about buying a house and my experience thus far. Their reaction was somewhere between calling me crazy and feeling sorry I’d chosen so early to settle down. At first, I was pretty stung. A little while later, I realized they hadn’t heard my reason for buying a house. They hadn’t been privy to the purpose. And that purpose, the answer to the question, “To what end?” makes a world of difference.</p>

<h4 id="faith-ispurpose">Faith is purpose</h4>

<p>Faith gives us the direction in answering that question, “To what end?” Faith is having an answer, a direction. Faith is the course we set, however without purpose, we have no way of determining where we’re headed in regards to that faith. It is one thing to believe in God, to serve our loving Savior, but it is another altogether to have purpose and know how He has made us to fit into that grand scheme. Without purpose, faith will take us everywhere, nowhere.</p>

<h4 id="to-each-theirown">To each their own</h4>

<p>We’re all going to have different purposes. The hospitable one isn’t going to have the same purpose as the pastor, just as the teacher isn’t going to have the same purpose as the merciful one. I’m not going into gifting here, but know that you have a purpose that is uniquely yours, tailored to the specific gifts you’ve received. You should be stretched, but your focus should be on your core competencies, if you will. And not everyone, not every believer, will understand or value your specific purpose.</p>

<h4 id="purpose-movingforward">Purpose moving forward</h4>

<p>I bought a house and I’m moving in soon because it fits who I am. My purpose is to tend to the hurting and help reorient the lost, restoring their purpose and rediscovering their heart. And this house serves as a space for this to take place. I’m sure it’ll serve greater objectives, but this is all I can see today. It’s this sense of purpose that guides me onward. It’s this sense of purpose that assures me I am headed in the right direction; it excites me. What is your purpose? Where is it leading you?</p>

<p>Seriously, ask yourself, “What is my purpose and where is it leading me?” Do you know? Ask your family, your friends. Make an evening out of it. Discover it. It’s not a matter of convenience, it’s a matter of life. Without purpose, how can we live and enjoy life fully in the way we were uniquely made to do so? We can’t. And friends, I don’t want that for any of us. The choice is yours, though.</p>

          <h2><a href="/thankful-beach-vacation-without-the-beach-8197f3c9a31/">thankful: beach vacation without the beach</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>I was elbow deep in the “berries”, what we’d affectionately referred to as the spidery, unending network of thorns with clusters of deceptively vibrant red berries. I was covered in sweat, sand and my muscles were aching after an hour of alternating shoveling and weeding. But, I was literally up to my elbows in thorns when my dad asks, “You want me to take over?” “No,” I reply, “I’m having fun.” You read what I typed before this, right? And as I rehashed the scenario afterwards, I realized that I was having fun and I was even thankful for the morning’s work I had nearly finished. Yeah, I’ll repeat that for myself, I was thankful.</p>

<h4 id="working-vacation">Working vacation</h4>

<p>Earlier that week I’d agreed to help my dad do some work around our beach house before rental season kicked into gear. Needless to say, my manager didn’t believe me when I told him that I was going down to the beach for the weekend, but it wasn’t going to be a vacation. That certainly wasn’t the hardest I’d ever worked, but there for sure was work that needed to be done and it took three men the better part of a weekend to do so.</p>

<h4 id="thankful-forthorns">Thankful for Thorns</h4>

<p>As I was rehashing my answer, realizing I was thankful for the thorns, I was reminded of the parable of the sower. I thought of how the Loving Farmer has taken the thorny soil in my own heart and lovingly, intentionally removed the weeds and briars from my own heart. I was reminded how thankful I am for His love and care in this work, which as labor intensive as it was for me, must be exponentially more for those thorns deep in my heart. No, I’m not thankful for the thorns themselves, but I <em>am</em> for the opportunity they provided my Father to show me how much He loves and cares for me.</p>

<h4 id="thankful-yet-thankless">Thankful yet thankless</h4>

<p>There are so many things we have to be thankful for, but if you’re anything like me, you take for granted. Look, I’ve even been taking something so awesome as a beach house for granted. And pulling thorns out of the front yard was the reminder I needed. I’m not exactly sure how I made that correlation, but that’s not the point. We’ve been given so much that we’re bound to forget. What matters isn’t so much the individual things we remember to give thanks for, but the knowledge that we’ve been given more than we have time to thank God for in an entire lifetime.</p>

<p>What do you have to be thankful for, friend, that you’ve been neglecting? For what have you ceased giving God His due praise? I challenge you and myself this week to find something new each day. Can’t think of something? Then praise Him for a new attribute about something old, but you can think of <em>something</em>. So, as you’re sitting around the patio, grilling, enjoying family, friends, let’s all be mind of how thankful we ought to be. Hey, maybe even let those people know you’re thankful for <em>them</em>. Who knows, it could be the beginning of the revolution in your world. Happy Memorial Day, friends!</p>

          <h2><a href="/essentials-of-faith-willing-to-struggle/">essentials of faith: willing to struggle</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>I have to admit, the past couple weeks have been rough. I’m moving into the new house in about a week, but the anticipation of moving in, knowing it’s there but just beyond my fingertips, is worse than not having at all. Now, there’s the anticipation of the move, the stress of coordinating the moving logistics, the pressure of finding the right sofa, the imperative to select the right color scheme. I don’t like details, in fact, I struggle with them mightily because I am a perfectionist, making each minute element into an epic task. As I think about my struggle caused by trivialities, I’m reminded of the necessary struggle that I’ve faced from time to time in my faith journey. And I can’t help but to be reminded how critical that struggle has been in the formation and reformation of my faith. No, this struggle hasn’t been a burden. Couches, well, that’s a different story.</p>

<h4 id="we-struggle-for-whatmatters">We struggle for what matters</h4>

<p>Simply, faith has to matter. And what’s true about every important thing in life: we fight for it. Faith isn’t tested or forged in still waters. Joy and thankfulness, maybe, but faith is tested in times of struggle, when we have little to nothing else to grasp onto. Faith is tested when we have nowhere else to turn, nowhere to run; faith is having no other answer. However, the question isn’t about will we struggle or not, but rather do we want to struggle? In other words, does faith matter?</p>

<h4 id="i-cant-answer-foryou">I can’t answer for you</h4>

<p>If you’ve read this far in the post, or moreover this far in the series (<a href="http://104.193.143.57/~waywar13/ce/getting-back-to-the-bare-essentials-of-faith/" title="Getting Back to the Bare Essentials of Faith">Getting Back to the Bare Essentials of Faith</a> and <a href="http://104.193.143.57/~waywar13/ce/essentials-of-faith-an-open-mind/" title="Essentials of Faith: An Open Mind">Essentials of Faith: An Open Mind</a>), faith obviously has to mean something to you. I <em>can</em> not, nor <em>will</em> I, attempt to answer the question for you. This you must decide for yourself. I can only tell you that it has literally been the only thing to have gotten me through some of the experiences I’ve had in my life. To reiterate, I would’ve killed myself several years ago were it not for faith. That’s just my story. If that resonates with you, please feel free to contact me via the email on the About page. However, if it doesn’t, there’s nothing I can do to change that.</p>

<h4 id="if-you-choose-faith-you-willstruggle">If you choose faith, you will struggle</h4>

<p>Jesus promised His followers they would struggle. In the same breath, He also promised right beforehand that He was peace.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I have said these things to you, that in me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation. But take heart; I have overcome the world.” — John 16:33</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You see the promise of struggle. You see that life, one we can assume dedicated to faith as He was speaking only to His disciples, was wrought with trials. What’s more important to note, however is that struggle is sandwiched in between peace and triumph. Before death on a cross and resurrection from the tomb, Jesus triumphantly declared He’d overcome the world. This declaration is no less true for our struggle today than it was around that table so many years ago. We will struggle, but not for nothing. When we struggle, we struggle for <em>everything</em>.</p>

<p>We will not struggle everyday, nor should we, but we need to be ready for when it does come, friends. Faith is important, important enough, to want in spite of struggle. Faith is enough in the midst of our struggle. But, we don’t struggle alone, nor do we struggle meaninglessly. Christ offered peace and promised triumph. We have both of these available to us today and tomorrow, yesterday and forever. Is our struggle too great? Is what we have to lose too much for the Savior? Is He not good enough to merit a little effort to draw nearer to Him? Struggle is up to you.</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p>I hope y’all had a good weekend. I wouldn’t consider myself rested, but somewhat refreshed after Sunday. Between a great message at my mom’s church and watching “Hitchcock”, I was reminded what this life is to look like. I was reminded that life is a headlong pursuit. Life is understanding God as Lord and spending all our waking hours using our gifts to love those around us, thus thanking God for what He’s given.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“When you find that people are warming themselves by the fire of your gift, this is Kingdom living.”</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="fire-islove">Fire is love</h4>

<p>Sharing what we have,<em>all</em> of what we have is really how we love those around us. That is just the idea behind the quote above from church on Sunday. Fully living life is sharing the most valuable parts of us, the gifts God has bestowed upon us with those around us. I get the idea of people huddled around a campfire, shivering from the cold at their backs. I think that is really what we’re to be. Warmth in a world we all can agree gets darn cold sometimes.</p>

<h4 id="fanning-to-love-those-aroundus">Fanning to love those around us</h4>

<p>This life isn’t about what we do, but <em>how</em> we do. I think that’s made quite clear in I Corinthians 13, and this is where “Hitchcock” struck me. Our life should be spent offering up all we have for a purpose that is bigger than us. We are constantly in need of fanning the flame that is the gift set within each of us. If we don’t improve our skills, our gifts, our passions, love those around us with them, we’re wasting them. It’s that simple. If we’re not loving those around us, we’re not growing.</p>

<p>Simply, we want to grow, and the way to do so is to love those around us with the gifts God has abundantly given. Pursuing a life of sharing those gifts is a life devoted to a cause that is far bigger than us. It’s not safe, it’s not normal, and there’s no guarantee. However, this is where God enters the picture. I could issue you assurance after assurance that He will not forsake you in this most ambitious of endeavors. I could tell you a million times that you’ll be fine. But I won’t. Go live it for yourself, friend. This is the best advice and reassurance I can give you. Break out of your small little world this Monday and love those around you for just a week. Then, tell me how you feel. Remember, we’re changing the world, friends. Nothing less.</p>

          <h2><a href="/essentials-of-faith-an-open-mind/">essentials of faith: an open mind</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>Last week, I mentioned starting a series on the <a href="http://104.193.143.57/~waywar13/ce/getting-back-to-the-bare-essentials-of-faith/" title="Getting Back to the Bare Essentials of Faith">Essentials of Faith</a>. This time last week, I said that the foundation to faith was grace in the post <a href="http://104.193.143.57/~waywar13/ce/grace-is-not-just-unmerited-favor/" title="Grace Is Not Just Unmerited Favor">Grace Is Not Just Unmerited Favor</a>. Today, I start out with the first thing I consider necessary to faith and that is an open mind. However, an open mind is something easier said than done as I think we’d all agree.</p>

<h4 id="church-of-the-closed-minded">Church of the closed-minded</h4>

<p>I think a lot of us would characterize the Christian Church in America this way. I wouldn’t openly argue with you. I think there are a lot of people white knuckling their faith. I don’t at all consider my faith journey typical, but I’ve only come across the opposite. Allow me to explain.</p>

<h4 id="the-mudslide-of-discovery">The mudslide of discovery</h4>

<p>I was intent on finding something to cling onto upon entering college. Emotionally, spiritually, I was a wreck, but I’d grown up in the church and I’d heard all the stories and the right answers. I wanted desperately to cling onto what I thought was about the only thing left that hadn’t washed away in the tumultuous years preceding. I began exploring my faith in my dorm room, in Bible studies, church. It didn’t leave me more secure in what I knew. In fact, it tore down most of it. I felt like I was witnessing an unstoppable mudslide smothering my soul. The last bastion of comfort and familiarity was slowly, surely sliding out from underneath me and burying me.</p>

<h4 id="the-seeds-of-an-openmind">The seeds of an open mind</h4>

<p>Exploring my faith wasn’t comforting me. In fact, it was unsettling me. I became depressed, but I felt my heart being called to carry on. So, I trudged on with an open mind, and a heart following. Six years later, and I’m still discovering and rediscovering my faith. However, the depression I suffered has long lifted. The fact of the matter is: my faith is in an infinite God and I can never know Him fully.</p>

<h4 id="open-mind-and-an-infinitegod">Open mind and an infinite God</h4>

<p>This isn’t daunting or depressing. In fact, it’s comforting. At no point will He fall short. At no point will He become stale or boring. There is always more. He is always bigger, stronger, more loving, more interesting, more amazing. God does not fail because He is always greater. I am understanding this more every day. At the same time, I realize I understand Him less every day. This is the paradox of the soul. I am content in Him, but I enthusiastically await the next time He will blow my conception again out of the water. This, my friends, is why an open mind is crucial to the life of faith. Without an open mind, our God cannot be more than the depiction on a stained glass window. And that is not our God.</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p>I face opposition and my immediate response is to back off or stop whatever it is that I’m doing. I don’t want to have to deal with this attack on me, so I turn tail and run. I wish I could give you one such opposition example, but too many come to mind. Suffice it to say, when I went to church this weekend with my mom (happy belated Mother’s Day to the mothers out there!), and there was talk of character, intention and integrity, the pastor had my attention. We were talking about what a man <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Nehemiah+1&amp;version=ESV" title="Nehemiah">Nehemiah</a> was back in the Old Testament, when these words were issued from the stage, “When we meet opposition, it’s against God, <em>not</em> us,” and a door opened for me. The opposition I face, the attacks on me, however slight, are not against <em>me</em> (that is, attacks in times when I am not actively rebelling against God’s love).</p>

<h4 id="why-do-we-face-opposition">Why do we face opposition?</h4>

<p>If you don’t believe there is good and evil in this world, I don’t know what to tell you, but there is. Furthermore, (spoiler alert) good will win. However, in the meantime, evil is a sore loser and tries to bring us down. Simply put, evil poses opposition to those trying to follow in the footsteps of good and God allows it sometimes. Before we go thinking God is sadistic, we need this opposition as it causes us to draw nearer to Him, rely more heavily on Him and see just how good and loving He really is. We need the darkness of opposition to show us just how bright a light God is.</p>

<h4 id="how-is-opposition-not-againstus">How is opposition not against us?</h4>

<p>Maybe it’s different for you, but my propensity to do evil is greater than I can stifle many days. I’m imperfect, therefore I will do things of which I’m ashamed and pretty much on a daily basis. The force of evil in this world is greater than me, for you it might be different. As such, I cannot thwart it alone and evil is keenly aware of this. In fact, I’m certain that evil is so certain of this, it doesn’t waste its time opposing <em>me</em>. No, evil is just using me as a pawn in its game to win out over good. Evil will stop at nothing to win, despite knowing it is all in vain. As far as it’s concerned, we are just collateral damage.</p>

<h4 id="how-we-confront-opposition">How we confront opposition</h4>

<p>We confront opposition with three things: prayer, community and carrying on. I’m sure I sound like a broken record player, but the first step to any sound response must be prayer. It should come naturally to us as breathing as we should look forward to and cherish the time we spend with God as with our best friends. He is here and He is more for us than the rest of the world combined. Secondly, we involve others in our struggle. That’s right, we burden those around us with our struggles, but many hands (or prayers) makes light work. There are so many reasons, but we need community; we were never meant to be alone, friend. Finally, with continued prayer by ourselves and others, together we trudge onward. We cannot just stop at “waiting for an answer”. Our waiting is active, therefore we must carry on in the face of opposition until our Father tells us otherwise.</p>

<p>We all know by now, we will face opposition, but it is not against <em>us</em>. The opposition we face is merely a part of life, the losing side in a battle for our souls; it draws us nearer to Good. Evil knows that we are incapable of withstanding it alone, so it exploits us for the advancement of its demonic purposes. It cares nothing about us or for us. However, through prayer, community and perseverance, God gives us the strength to withstand any affront, any attack. While evil is beyond us, it is far beneath good. It is against good that evil fights, but it is only good who will stand in the end. Let us stand today, friend, in that assurance. And let us stand tall. Happy Monday!</p>

          <h2><a href="/grace-is-not-just-unmerited-favor/">grace is not just unmerited favor</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <blockquote>
  <p>“Grace, it’s not just unmerited favor. It’s unmerited favor that is first and foremost forwarding a cause greater than we could ever understand.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m not sure how many times grace has been defined to me, but I assure you it’s been hashed and rehashed several times. I think most of us have a pretty good grasp on the dictionary definition, being an undeserved gift, favor. Yes, you’ve been given a gift you could never earn, but nonetheless, one that has your name on it. But, the point of the gift wasn’t for your enjoyment. It really wasn’t for you in the grand scheme of things. The big picture reason for grace is that it forwards God’s plan that is already in action. Because it brings <em>Him</em> joy, He gives us grace to bring <em>us</em> joy. <strong>Grace is much bigger than us</strong>.</p>

<h4 id="big-grace">Big grace</h4>

<p>Grace must inherently be bigger than us. If it is not, then our faith merely equates to self-glorification or self-worship. Spirituality is nothing more than a race to see who can climb higher on the totem pole of self-fulfillment. No, grace is from a God too big for any to comprehend, to a people who could never repay. Grace is not a debt. Once again, it’s bigger than you, it’s bigger than simple recompense. We have been given a gift from a God who’s infinite, shouldn’t the value of this gift, if the Giver is truly benevolent, be of a similar magnitude? Shouldn’t this gift be priceless? And if this gift is priceless, of infinite worth, how can mere mortals assume the full value is for their benefit alone? No, grace must be meant for more.</p>

<h4 id="we-denygrace">We deny grace</h4>

<p>The grace we were given was declared complete by Jesus Himself, yet we act to the contrary. We fall short and we try to make up for it. We subscribe to various religious acts in the hopes that God is watching our piety, noting the deposits into our spiritual bank accounts. We write “grace” on a flag and wave it brazenly as we run headlong through the no man’s land of licentiousness. In each of these scenarios, we deny what grace truly is and how valuable a gift we were given freely.</p>

<h4 id="grace-is-aparadox">Grace is a paradox</h4>

<p>Grace is for each individually, yet it is at the same time for God alone. On the micro level, God has given each of us a gift individualized perfectly for who He made us. On the macro level, grace is God showing there is none greater, more caring, loving. It is God’s joy to bring us joy through the lavish gift of grace.</p>

<p>Grace is the crux of the Christian faith, but we often get confused in its purpose as a result of our individualistic culture. Grace is meant to bring us joy individually. But, it’s so much bigger than this. Grace isn’t about us. Grace is about turning all our heads upwards and bringing joy and recognition to the Giver, its source. Grace is too valuable a gift to be solely purposed for our mere enjoyment or benefit. Grace is too big for us, but like clothes too big for an infant, it gives us room to grow into it. And grow we will continue to do all the days of our lives. Thank You, Father.</p>

          <h2><a href="/getting-back-to-the-bare-essentials-of-faith/">getting back to the bare essentials of faith</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>I spent this past weekend camping with some family members. Leaving there Sunday, I was a little dismayed. I love the woods and I think God uses nature as one of the primary ways to speak to me, but I left the campsite without even a parting whisper from Him. It wasn’t until several miles down the road it hit me. The purpose of this trip, the words He was speaking to my soul was the realization that once again, life has gotten too complicated. I’ve burdened faith with appearance, cast it aside with temporal concerns and battered it with superfluous practices. Bottom line: camping this past weekend symbolized my need to return to the bare essentials.</p>

<h4 id="what-are-the-bare-essentials">What are the bare essentials?</h4>

<p>That’s an excellent question, but ultimately one I’ll answer over the next few weeks as I answer it for myself. As I said, I only realized I’d strayed from the essentials yesterday, so I haven’t had much time to process. However, I can’t imagine those essentials being without prayer, community, Bible reading or giving back to the community.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast. For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them.” — Ephesians 2:8–10</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="we-start-withgrace">We start with grace</h4>

<p>Without grace, there is no Christianity. Without grace, we have karma and Christianity is no different from any other religion, maybe it’s worse. I’m not claiming grace to be the clinching factor in making Christianity right. No, I’m saying that before we start with essentials, we have to understand of <em>what</em> we are returning to the essentials. It is grace that we have chosen to receive and (without going too deep into theology), it is by grace we were chosen to receive it. Do we laud the poor person accepting the handout or the rich person who gave, so the poorer might have? In the same way, we can’t take credit for what has been given again and again to us freely. I’ll expound more on this Thursday, but I will say it one more time: it is imperative we understand grace before we understand the essentials of faith.</p>

<h4 id="what-are-your-essentials">What are your essentials?</h4>

<p>Friends, what do you consider to be essential to your faith? What are the aspects without which you could not do? What does grace look like to you? Have I put the cart before the horse in considering grace before the “essentials”? Friends, I’m asking for your feedback.

          <h2><a href="/saying-no-or-the-art-of-maybe/">saying no or the art of maybe</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>The most difficult word for me to say in the English language (so far) is ‘no’. I don’t like saying no. It’s as if I’m not only letting down the person to whom I’ve said “no”, but myself in the process. However, I know I’m not the only one who’s allergic to saying no. Yes, that’s me making myself feel more normal in my insecurity. But, beyond that, I find there’s an unspoken tension between such certain statements as saying no and the impermanence of life and situations. In other words, how can I say no to something that tomorrow will be completely different? Here is the art of maybe.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Do not boast about tomorrow, for you do not know what a day may bring.” — Proverbs 27:1</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The problem with saying no is it is so definite and permanent. It is the black to the world’s grey. Let’s face it, people change, situations change, our values change. Sometimes, these changes occur over months, weeks, days, but they can even occur in minutes or moments. As our knowledge of the situation changes or our value systems used to evaluate those situations change, we are forced to revisit our judgments. We’re forced to reexamine our reasons for saying no and may find the thing to which we said no earlier is, for one reason or another, something completely different now.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Let what you say be simply ‘Yes’ or ‘No’; anything more than this comes from evil.” — Matthew 5:37</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While these words were issued in the context of oaths, this is a call to saying no. Jesus is very clearly telling us that we need to either be saying yes or saying no. The latter half of the sentence is very strongly worded. He leaves no room for doubt that we are to answer in the definite. In other words, there is no room for “maybe”. In a world filled with grey, we are to answer in the black and white. You’ve heard it from the proverbial horse’s mouth. But, herein lies the tension I perceive.</p>

<h4 id="saying-no-in-the-here-andnow">Saying no in the here and now</h4>

<p>How do we reconcile our impermanence with our call to straightforwardness and integrity? If you’ll allow me to go out on a short limb, it is saying no. But, it is saying no with the full knowledge of <em>why</em> we are saying no. It’s making a definitive judgment with definitive criteria. And when the situation changes or our criteria, our values, change, we reevaluate. We say no, but we know that for most things we are saying not now. We only have control over how we perceive and how we react to those perceptions. We do not have control over our circumstances or the future. Maybe this reevaluation process, if done more regularly, would do us all some good.</p>

<p>It should come as no surprise that we live in tension here on earth. We are called both to live in the moment and to make stiff decisions within a world of impermanence. We cannot count on tomorrow, on the one hand. On the other, let your ‘yes’ be ‘yes’. Yet, if we’re truly making decisions, weighing the options and the costs, we know why we’re saying yes or saying no. We are in tune with how we arrived at those decisions. In turn, we can make definitive judgments on situations that may be concrete as water. That way, we can say ‘maybe’, but we can also say ‘no’. Because, we allow for the situation to change, but we’re aware of where it falls short that would allow us to say ‘yes’. So, say ‘no’, but in saying no it’s OK to mean ‘not now’. Just don’t say ‘yes’ to killing babies.</p>

          <h2><a href="/we-all-just-need-to-take-a-break/">we all just need to take a break</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>So, friend, how’s your Monday going? Did you have a good weekend? I’ll bet you could use a break right about now. I’ll also go so far as to assume that while your weekend was good, it hasn’t refreshed you for today like you thought it might. Then again, maybe I’m wrong. Maybe you’re hitting your stride for the afternoon and a break is the last thing your productivity needs. That may be true, but I’ll be willing to bet that you, like me, could use some true rest that not only allowed you to catch up on your sleep, but also refreshed your soul.</p>

<h4 id="why-dont-you-allow-yourself-abreak">Why don’t you allow yourself a break?</h4>

<p>I’d imagine the idea of a break sounds lovely to you, but there’s just not enough time. A respite would be wonderful, but what about the kids, the clients, project, you name it? There is always something holding us back. There’s always someone, some_thing_ telling us that we have external responsibilities that trump our need to get rest. The rest of the world is relying on us never taking a break, because we’ll only miss out on that one opportunity or we’ll let down the wrong person. Ask yourself, “Is that true?”</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.” — Matthew 11:28–30</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe I’m making up a problem that isn’t real. Maybe I’m putting too much emphasis on these words. Maybe I’m the one who needs a break because I don’t understand His words. I certainly wouldn’t argue with the latter point. However, I know there has to be a reason why this country is filled with people who spend the most time at work, but are no happier for it. I know that while we take lavish vacations to exotic places, have the best weekends going out with our friends, most of us come into the week limping because we’re still not rested. So, I turn to you. Do you need a break? If you do, to where will you turn for that break?</p>

          <h2><a href="/fasting-for-the-answer-to-prayer/">fasting for the answer to prayer</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>I’m fasting today. Yes, you read that correctly. Why? That’s an excellent question. Probably because I’m a sadist and I like watching myself suffer. No, there are a few reasons, but they all boil down to the fact that I’m expecting answers to some prayer for both myself and good friends. I’ve found there’s no better way to focus on prayer than when your stomach is empty. There is little that will bring me to my knees faster and more consciously than hunger. I love my food. However, today, it takes a backseat to jobs not found and a house that’s being bought. It takes a secondary importance to petitioning the God who provides it all.</p>

<h4 id="why-am-ifasting">Why am I fasting?</h4>

<p>More specifically, I’m fasting to both show dedication and pray more. Without delving too deep into theology and Biblical history, there are just some problems that require us to show a little more resolution in our prayer. I feel like the prayers at hand are important enough to merit a more serious approach. Also, it’s because of this importance that I’ve chosen fasting to help increase my frequency of prayer. Yeah, there are just some things that are this important.</p>

<h4 id="why-are-you-notfasting">Why are you not fasting?</h4>

<p>What prayers do you have unanswered? What friends, family do you know of languishing waiting on the answer to prayer? What life-changing answers are you awaiting? The answer isn’t to give up. The answer is to continue praying. Maybe even pray harder. And that’s where fasting comes in. I guess my question to you is how badly do you want it?</p>

<p>There’s a reason fasting has been practiced since the ancient times. I’m not saying it’s lost on this generation, but it’s long been underrated by a society devoted to gluttony and more. We’re so quick to try new diets, but how about a diet for your complacent soul? How about cutting back on the physical bread we eat and letting God make up the difference with <em>His</em> manna? Our God wants to answer our prayers, I promise you He does. Sometimes, He just wants to <em>see</em> that we want Him to answer our prayers. Sometimes, He wants to see we’re responsible in our requests. Just sometimes, fasting is required to show our hearts are dead set on His provision and there is no other option. Friend, for what do you have to be fasting and why aren’t you?</p>

          <h2><a href="/hope-for-the-new-week/">hope for the new week</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>I think we can all agree last week was just a rough week. I don’t even want to name the events specifically right now, because it’s still rather fresh in my mind. But this time last week, I was away at a trade show watching on repeat a bomb going off. Again and again, thanks to ESPN, my stomach churned. And it’s unsettled as that memory is brought back to the forefront. With all the death and destruction, I went into the weekend in need of some good encouragement. I needed to be reminded of hope. I will mention West, Boston, Watertown just this once to say, my prayers are with you as together we begin to piece life back together. Because we all have been affected by your grief.</p>

<h4 id="how-can-the-god-of-hope-allow-suchtragedy">How can the God of hope allow such tragedy?</h4>

<p>You want the real Christian perspective? I don’t know. I know God will use the events of last week to bring hope, restoration and reconciliation to some, but how and why, I’m not skilled enough to understand. I really don’t know how God can use such devastation to further His good and perfect plans for this world. But maybe that’s the conundrum in finding hope from an omnipotent God. Maybe, just maybe my lack of understanding points to just how amazing He really is. I know He’s incredible, but could all this prove Him more so? Or maybe it’s to prove that there is no hope outside of Him.</p>

<h4 id="searching-foranswers">Searching for answers</h4>

<p>Needless to say, I’ll need to continue to do a fair amount of praying this week. Maybe as details are released, we’ll all have a better clue. I pray that sooner rather than later we’ll all come to peace and understanding. I have faith even now that there is hope to be found in this mess. But, I cannot find it in myself. And I cannot rely on others to provide it for me. Call it a crutch, call it the opium of the masses, I will run back to my Savior. I will run back to the Sustainer, because I know nowhere else to turn. Because I need hope more than answers right now and that can only be provided by my Father.</p>

<h4 id="looking-forwardtogether">Looking forward together</h4>

<p>As I said earlier, we were all affected in some way by last week. Directly or indirectly, we were all wounded. So, it only makes sense that we move forward <em>together</em>. It only makes sense that we hold up one another as we trudge onward, one step at a time. It only makes sense that we lift the heads of our brothers and sisters around us to the light of hope before us. It only makes sense that we, <em>all</em>, come together. As children of the Creator, we need to embrace our common bonds and cling collectively to our Hope.</p>

<p>Last week was one none of us will soon forget. I can’t give you reasons for why God would allow such things, but I can tell you where I’m looking for my hope. Having searched high and low, I’ve only found it in God. I’ve only found it completed in coming together as His sons and daughters and calling out to Him, petitioning Him for hope, for love. Why? Where else can I find peace? Where else can I find comfort and understanding? I don’t know the what, when or the why, friends. But I do know the how and where. Hope and healing only will come from us coming together and drawing collectively together toward our Father.</p>

          <h2><a href="/prayer-is-a-way-of-life/">prayer is a way of life</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>Prayer in my experience always has started with some form of “Dear God” and ended with one variation of “Amen.” I’d imagine most of you have a similar experience. But, as I’ve been thinking about prayer this week (sitting on a flight to and from Sin City will do that to you), I’ve come to the conclusion that I’m still doing it wrong. I’ve come to realize that my view of prayer is flawed from the very start. But, that’s because I’ve never really sat down and understood what prayer is at its core.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Prayer is an invocation or act that seeks to activate a rapport with [God] through deliberate communication. Prayer…may be either individual or communal and take place in public or in private. It may involve the use of words or song. When language is used, prayer may take the form of a hymn, incantation, formal creed, or a spontaneous utterance in the praying person. There are different forms of prayer such as petitionary prayer, prayers of supplication, thanksgiving, and worship/praise. Prayer may be…for the purpose of worshipping, requesting guidance, requesting assistance, confessing sins or to express one’s thoughts and emotions. Thus, people pray for many reasons such as personal benefit or for the sake of others. — <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prayer" title="Wikipedia Prayer">Wikipedia</a></p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="prayer-is-deliberate-communication">Prayer is deliberate communication</h4>

<p>Read the first sentence one more time. Prayer is an invocation or act that provides direct communication with God. Friends, what I’m doing right now is prayer. The very words you are reading right now are my prayer. Prayer is anything that brings you closer to God. For some, it may be feeding the homeless. For others, it may be gardening. And others still, perhaps rock climbing. Prayer isn’t just “bow your heads and close your eyes.” And that’s exactly where my view of prayer needed mending.</p>

<h4 id="prayer-is-not-anact">Prayer is not an act</h4>

<p>Just because we’re doing what we love and it makes us feel alive as we’ve been individually wired, doesn’t mean we’re actually praying. I can be in the habit of restoring sex trade victims all my life and that not be prayer. The pitfall is, prayer is not formulaic. It is not a series of steps. It <em>is</em> a posturing of the heart and mind. Prayer is not the what, but the why.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal. And if I have prophetic powers, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. If I give away all I have, and if I deliver up my body to be burned, but have not love, I gain nothing. — <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20cor%2013:1-3&amp;version=ESV" title="1 Corinthians 13:1-3">I Corinthians 13:1–3</a></p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="pray-tolive">Pray to live</h4>

<p>Simply, we pray because we must to live. If Jesus really is the Life (emphasis on the capital ‘l’), then to have part, or <em>partake</em> for those looking for the Christian buzzword, in that Life, we have to actively do so. Prayer is that striving. Prayer is also the evidence of that Life in us. Friend, do not think too lowly of prayer. It is nothing less than our lifeline. Should it not also be our lifeblood? Even Jesus, who was God, used prayer to petition God daily for His daily bread. <em>Especially</em> Jesus prayed constantly when His time was drawing near to meet His fate on the cross. But, more importantly, He prayed in the interim. Is it not all the more important for us who are not God?</p>

<p>Prayer is how we communicate with God. But, it is not limited in the way that religion has taught us for too long. Prayer is broad and prayer is free. But, it is not without a specific posture of the heart that takes our base actions, thoughts or words and directs them to heaven. It’s the heart that changes action into prayer. And, dear friend, we need to pray. We, I for sure, desperately need to pray. Because these bones will condemn me to death if I try to live any other way. Because I forget so easily and turn from the God who loves me so. Simply, I don’t want that. He is far too good to cast Him aside like refuse. Because Life is too good. How are you praying today?</p>

            <p>Most, if not all, of us have prayed for God to provide for us. And I know I’m not alone in saying I prefer the answer to that prayer to come right then and there. I’m really praying that my prayer is enough action on my part to show God I’m serious about what I’m asking. You know what, often it is. But, there are times it isn’t. When it isn’t, then what do we do? I was reminded of the answer today as I’ve continued reading through <em>The Circle Maker</em>.</p>

<h4 id="we-wade-into-thewater">We wade into the water</h4>

<p>The Israelites were standing on the east bank of the Jordan River, waiting for a miracle like the parting of the Red Sea, so they could cross and claim the land God had promised them hundreds of years ago. When they got to the Red Sea, sure, they had to wait, but at the right time, God opened up a path through the water, and they waltzed across the sea floor without getting a drop on themselves. He did it once, so why wouldn’t He do it again? That’s exactly what I would have been thinking. Maybe I’m not so different from the Israelites after all. However, after praying, God told the priests to wade into the water a few steps. This seems a little strange to me, and it no doubt did to them, but they did as they were told. And it was because this act of obedience, the Israelites were finally able to take possession of the promise of old. They were finally able to inhabit the land of milk and honey.</p>

<h4 id="do-you-wantit">Do you want it?</h4>

<p>This is the question God was asking the Israelites when He gave the command to walk into the water. “I know this sounds crazy,” He says, “But How much do you trust me? How much do you want what I’ve promised you?” Has this ever happened to you? I worked a paid internship outside Philadelphia and it concluded sooner than I’d planned based on some complicated circumstances. I spent the next couple months searching for jobs. I knew God was going to give me a job, and a good one at that. However, before He delivered the job I currently hold into my lap, I needed to go through a few interviews first. And it was through that process I began to understand better God’s provision.</p>

<h4 id="what-is-yourpromise">What is your promise?</h4>

<p>What is it that God has promised you? What has He not given? Could it be that you’re standing on the opposite bank of the Jordan just waiting for God to act? Could it also be that He’s waiting for you to act? What does dipping your feet in the water look like for you? Do you think maybe He’s asking you to do that in faith? Is it making that deposit? Making that awkward phone call? Or is it quitting that job? I know it’s uncomfortable. It seems a little strange, crazy, nonsensical, I’m sure. However, if He’s asking you to do it, I guarantee there’s a perfect reason for it. You’ll probably be looked at. People may call you crazy, question your understanding of God and tell you you’re wrong. But, what God’s telling you isn’t necessarily for them to understand. Whatever it is, what’s imperative is you act. Otherwise, you may forfeit the gift at the precipice. And that’s a shame.</p>

<p>We all know what asking for God’s provision, in one way or another, is like. We ask, but we’re really asking for Him to work in the here and now without anymore effort required on our part. However, that’s not the way it works all the time. Sometimes, there’s another step required to show we’re serious about the request we’re making. And usually that step will take us a bit into off territory. Our job is to not turn back at the blessing’s door. Instead, we take that step, because anything God asks us to do can’t be all that crazy in the grand scheme of things. Or can it..?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I stumbled upon the tweet above yesterday. It was by no accident. Why? Because I just read these words in the book <a href="http://thecirclemaker.com/" title="The Circle Maker">The Circle Maker</a> by Mark Batterson which had been recommended to me by two completely unrelated people in the same week. Friends, <em>this</em> is how God works. <em>This</em> is how God is getting me to dream and pray. And <em>this</em> is how He’s getting me to understand that dreams and prayer are one in the same. And that without dreams, without prayer, we are merely dying.</p>

<h4 id="living-isnt-a-function-of-breathing">Living isn’t a function of breathing</h4>

<p>When it comes to living, I’m not calling Descartes a liar. Well, I am, but only because most of us narrowly define the word “think”. Without digressing too far, whether we are living or dying has nothing to do with breathing, eating, or anything else we consider the core functions of life. No, the essence of life is a growing relationship with our Father. The only way for it to grow is to pray and dream and watch God blow our minds time and time again. Only through this process can we begin to understand God, appreciate God and ultimately <em>love</em> God. Growth only happens when we allow God to stretch our understandings of Him. And sometimes, if we’re doing it right, it hurts.</p>

<h4 id="break-free">Break free</h4>

<p>Whether we like it or not, we live in a culture that shackles wisdom to routine and facts. Those seen stepping out of line will be treated harshly. What’s worse, the Church seems to be harsher still. I don’t wish to throw out customs, traditions, and certainly not facts, but I challenge the weight we afford faith. I challenge our understanding of crazy. What we don’t understand, we call crazy. Or worse. Did anyone call Jesus crazy when He told the disciples to bring Him the five loaves and two fish with a crowd of five thousand? Did anyone call Him crazy when He gave thanks before feeding the masses? Is not all of this crazy, though? No. With a smile, I say emphatically it’s not at all.</p>

<h4 id="living-isboldness">Living is boldness</h4>

<p>Living isn’t “God, help me find a parking spot.” He accomplished more than that on the Seventh Day. Living is asking God to do things we have no chance of doing on our own and we are unsure at best that He can do on a good day. Living is asking God to part the Red Sea in the face of certain death at the hands of the Egyptian army. Living is petitioning God for meat in the middle of the desert to feed 600,000. Look that story up in <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=numbers%2011&amp;version=ESV" title="Numbers 11">Numbers 11</a>. Living is crazy.</p>

<p>In this life, we’re either living or dying. If we’re not imagining, dreaming, praying, we’re dying. That’s all there is to it. That is, if we’re not willing to venture into the areas of our doubt, we are stagnating, thus we’re dying. Friends, I’ll be the first to admit, I’m timid to be living. But I’d be writing my own ticket to hell if I didn’t at least explore a life of big, bold, crazy prayer. But, I can’t do it alone. Friends, who’s with me?</p>

          <h2><a href="/i-am-the-thing-holding-me-back/">i am the thing holding me back</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>Have you ever asked yourself the question “what’s holding me back?” And what was the answer to that question? Because this past weekend I found myself asking this very question. I mean, I wouldn’t so much consider myself stuck spiritually, but wary of allowing myself to get to that point. So I asked the question and what I heard back was “you”. As in, <em>I</em> am the thing holding me back. This caught me off guard, as I was expecting maybe an attribute or aspect, but certainly not this. And then He explained Sunday morning.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“ No unbelief made [Abraham] waver concerning the promise of God, but he grew strong in his faith as he gave glory to God, fully convinced that God was able to do what he had promised. That is why his faith was ‘counted to him as righteousness.’” — <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%204:20-22&amp;version=ESV" title="Romans 4:20-22">Romans 4:20–22</a></p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="unbelief-is-holding-meback">Unbelief is holding me back</h4>

<p>Abraham was convinced that God would do all He promised. This fact is the difference between average Cameron and Father Abraham. Things get bad, the situation starts to look bleak and I feel the need to take the reins. That’s the point where Abraham would pray and pray harder. And I think this difference breaks down to Abraham having no doubt about who God is. Somewhere along the line, I’ve settled for a god far less capable and loving. Intrinsically, there’s nothing wrong with this, per se, however I follow Christ and this is far from the God whom He intimately called Father.</p>

<h4 id="shame-holds-usback">Shame holds us back</h4>

<p>We live in a culture that values proving individual worth. This is a critical fact that we need to agree upon moving forward. Whether it plays out as a mistrust of authority, lack of faith in others or a need to prove ourselves, the impetus is generally strikingly similar. It is this very need to prove individual worth that tears our reliance and affections from God. It is this very core of our society that blinds us to the part of our heart that is dying. We want so badly to be righteous, to enjoy God’s best for our lives, but we can’t allow Him to follow through. We have to help along the process in some way to prove we can do it, to prove we’re worth it. But God’s already told us that long ago.</p>

<h4 id="prayer-is-holding-meback">Prayer is holding me back</h4>

<p>Have you ever prayed to believe? As a request in your prayer, have you ever asked God to increase your faith? If you haven’t, stop what you’re doing. If you have and it hasn’t worked, how long did you pray? You, also, need to stop what you’re doing. In your prayer, I want you to include two things. One, ask God to help you believe. Two, tell both Him and yourself you know He’ll follow through. No, you won’t believe it. It’ll be a lie. But faith isn’t always strolls through daisy-strewn fields in sunlight, skipping hand-in-hand. Faith is forged through the days we slog through the mud. And faking it till we are made is a prime example of this. Only, don’t stop until you believe it. Don’t stop until He’s granted your request. He will. I know it.</p>

<p>Before we start to blame our stagnant faith on circumstances, we have to accept that <em>we</em> are the very things holding ourselves back. We’ve had help from society, but ultimately it’s up to us to desire a deeper, fulfilling relationship with our Father. I’ve told you that shame and my lack of prayer are holding me back. Maybe that’s not the crux of the matter for you, but I guarantee prayer is a large part of the answer. I’d be surprised if it isn’t <em>the</em> answer. But, it’s <em>your</em> life. So, what are you waiting for? It’s time to get stepping, or should I say <em>praying</em>, friends.</p>

          <h2><a href="/faith-is-what-im-learning/">faith is: what i’m learning</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>Faith is a topic slippery as an eel. Given that I’m referring to faith in an infinite being, it would be unfitting for this faith to be any more concrete. Friends, I’m learning that this week. While I’ve found many things in my short years that faith is <em>not</em>, I’d like to take a few minutes and share with you what this week has shown me it <em>is</em>.</p>

<h4 id="faith-isprayer">Faith is prayer</h4>

<p>Confident, bold prayer is truly faith, my friends. I think this to be the most evident form of faith. Maybe I’m wrong, but how much courage does it take to storm the doors of the royal court and make one’s plea in the full knowledge the King will acquiesce? How much does one have to believe in the goodness and love of our Father to humbly request the desires of their heart and not doubt He will provide and <em>abundantly</em>? But this is precisely to what we’re called; this is what we’re pleaded with to do daily. And the mind-blowing aspect to all of this is that it makes God indescribably happy.</p>

<h4 id="faith-isaction">Faith is action</h4>

<p>I consider this a corollary to my first point, but prayer is nothing without acting upon it. When God grants our prayers, gives us some direction, it’s imperative we follow through. We may not understand, and oftentimes I don’t, but that is the essence of faith. We will ruffle feathers. We will rock the boat. And those around us will question our sanity. All of these things have been happening since the days of Abraham. Why should the cease now? Without the inexplicable, faith is nothing more than academic and God is far bigger than a collection of facts and figures.</p>

<h4 id="faith-is-bigger-thanus">Faith is bigger than us</h4>

<p>This life isn’t about you or me. It isn’t about today or tomorrow or even yesterday. Faith is about eternity, infinity, things that words cannot encompass. The need for faith isn’t borne of joy, happiness or charity. Faith is from God. It is a gift given so that we may enjoy gifts bigger than all our senses. Faith is the only way we can hope to begin to live a purpose, from God, that is guaranteed bigger than our mortal selves. Simply, how can we hope to experience or enjoy an infinite God without a gift such as faith?</p>

<p>I’m still learning what faith is, but I’ve seen it this week to be active. It is boldness in the asking. It is assuredness in the following. It is allowing the infinite to be just that. We have been given grace in the past so that we may be fortified in the future. We’ve been given God, a gift no one could hope to contain, so that we would have to share. But we must share. Because God is that big. And it’s only because of faith we know Him at all. It’s only because of Him we have any part in Him. No, it doesn’t make sense, but I don’t want to wrap my head around this brilliant, beautiful God. Because He is.</p>

          <h2><a href="/giving-up-in-an-age-of-control/">giving up in an age of control</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>I hope everyone had an enjoyable Easter weekend. I know I did, but amidst the family, food, Easter egg hunt (in which I look forward to participating all year long), and the talk of Jesus on the cross, I felt there was something missing that my heart longed to hear. Missing from the talk of Christ’s triumph, His sacrifice and glorification was His very distinct, pronounced act of giving up. And with the upcoming tumult of a move to yet another new locale, giving up control is the <em>opposite</em> of all I want.</p>

<h4 id="giving-up-indefeat">Giving up in defeat</h4>

<p>I know we think immediately of defeat when we hear the words ‘giving up.’ Look at the account of Jesus going to <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2026:36-46&amp;version=ESV" title="Gethsemane">Gethsemane</a>. Right before Jesus is betrayed, handed over, tortured and crucified, we have Jesus very distinctly giving up. Jesus voices His request to the Father, but accepts God’s purpose for His life as a sacrifice. There is no defeat in this account. There is no defeat in Jesus rousing the sleeping disciples, explicitly saying He is to meet His betrayal. This act of giving up is the ultimate act of courage. Empowerment.</p>

<h4 id="the-art-of-lettinggo">The art of letting go</h4>

<p>Letting go, giving up, something so apparently easy for Jesus, is not so for us. Why? It’s maddening in its simplicity. Jesus knew intimately the One to whom He was giving over control. He’d spent His entire life devoted to knowing and understanding God. He knew who God was, is, through intense study and countless experiences. To Him, there was no greater purpose in life. To me, there are so many competing interests and hobbies. For Christ, the choice was evident at a young age. He never wavered from His purpose. Giving up was merely a necessary step along His path.</p>

<h4 id="giving-up-and-over-thecliff">Giving up and over the cliff</h4>

<p>Giving up feels like letting go of the last handhold as we’re hanging hopelessly over an endless cliff. Giving up doesn’t make sense. It is the opposite of every desire within us. But it’s not. Giving up is precisely what our souls were made to do. Living a life yielded to the perfectly loving Father is every heart’s content. But, after years of hustle and toil, that deepest desire to know and be known by our Maker has been lost beneath the shuffle. Like a seed amongst the weeds, it’s nearly been choked to death. But it’s not too late to revive our hearts.</p>

<p>Giving up isn’t defeat, but the beginning to life. We daily fight for control, but to what end? If we look to Jesus as the author and perfecter of our faith, then we cannot miss the account of His letting go in the garden of Gethsemane. The path to His glorification began with a painstaking documentation of His giving up. But, this lesson seems lost on us today. It seems glossed over in the American version of triumph at Calvary. Where is the real victory found?</p>

          <h2><a href="/prayer-there-is-no-purpose-without-it/">prayer: there is no purpose without it</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>No discussion of purpose is complete without the word ‘prayer’. This fact is being driven home every step I’ve taken the past few months. As I move forward with buying a house, I am reminded anew today. I purposed man without prayer is a warship without a rudder. Sure, it is powerful, intimidating, but nothing more than a disaster in the making. As I’m redoubling my efforts to spend time in my Bible each morning, going through the Psalms, I am constantly amazed at the author. I’ve not even made it a third of the way through after many months, but I’m struck by the strength of their prayer life. Through despair, joy, defeat, victory, there is prayer after prayer. Jumping off the page is a certainty, a directness in the calls issued to the Father. And I can’t help but to feel envious, inferior.</p>

<h4 id="prayer-with-recklessabandon">Prayer with reckless abandon</h4>

<p>There are pages of precise requests of God. There is boldness issued to a loving God in machine gun fashion. You see the beating, bleeding heart of a king desperately seeking The King. You see vulnerability, painful reality smeared across the pages. There is nothing left to the imagination in the pleas or the thanksgiving of the psalmist. Laid bare before your eyes, you see what a prayer life abandoned to loving God with all one’s heart looks like. It’s like an x-ray of the soul. Is this not a living, breathing example of <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews%204:13&amp;version=ESV" title="Hebrews 4:13">Hebrews 4:13</a>?</p>

<h4 id="prayer-ispurpose">Prayer is purpose</h4>

<p>We all want purpose in life, but how do we discern purpose? As I’m learning, it’s only through conversation with the Source of Purpose. If it’s life we seek, then we must consult Life Himself (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2014:1-14&amp;version=ESV" title="John 14:1-14">John 14:6</a>). Prayer is like anything else, to get a substance at its purest, we must find the source. And the only way we can bridge the infinite gap, we must rely on a perfect Savior and His constant intercession in prayer. But, not just any prayer. We are not villagers outside the kingdom gates pleading for a bucket of water. We are adopted sons and daughters, heirs of the King. Do you not know what kind of assurance and confidence our Father desires for us? Do you now know how much joy it gives Him when we are secure in His strength, love and provision? No, you don’t. You will never. And neither do I. That thought brings a tear to my eyes as I type.</p>

<p>In the days leading up the remembrance of Christ’s ultimate sacrifice, I beg us to rethink our attitude toward communing with Him. I ask us all to reconsider our prayer, or the lack thereof in my case. We all long for purpose. But purpose apart from prayer, disconnected from God, its source, is not purpose at all. So, pray. Pray as your life depends on it. Pray as your very soul does, as well. Pray boldly. Pray confidently. Pray often. And you will see the face of God smiling as never before. Life could never be the same. How beautiful.</p>

          <h2><a href="/my-lonely-confession/">my lonely confession</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>I counted last night and I’ve moved seven times in less than half as many years. I’m a nomad. I’m a vagabond. And I have to move one more time. However, this will be the move to end them all. For awhile. I found a house over the weekend and you wouldn’t believe my relief. Not only is the search for a new house over, but I’m tired of uprooting constantly. However, this post isn’t about a house, or even a building. It’s about being lonely. It’s about the struggles of lonely people that go unnoticed, ignored.</p>

<h4 id="the-lonelysocial">The lonely social</h4>

<p>I’m not your textbook extrovert, but I need people around me. While living with my dad the past four months or so has been a real gift in many ways, it’s also been a bitter trial. But this is the chain of events I set in motion the day I got my DUI. I needed a way to get to work, appointments and court. My lease was ending and I wanted to save up for this house. It was a conscious decision I made and I’m grateful to have had the option, but it’s not been without the drawback of loneliness.</p>

<h4 id="jesus-thesolitary">Jesus the solitary</h4>

<p>For those of you who’ve studied the book of Mark, you’ll notice Jesus is often noted as going off alone to pray. Did I mention <em>often</em>? However, while He was <em>alone</em>, he was never <em>lonely</em>. He had the Twelve with Him most of the livelong day. But, He, as we should note, needed solitude. He needed to spend moments, extended ones, with the Father. But, He was <em>with</em> the Father. Physically, He was alone, but He always had His tight-knit community nearby.</p>

<h4 id="moving-fromlonely">Moving from lonely</h4>

<p>Community, people, is why I’m excited to be moving one more time. I am ready. I’ve been ready to have people around me and to appreciate them like never before. I’m dying to share meals, tears, laughs and shouts of joy with these people. However, without the darkness, how can we appreciate the light? Friends, the dark of being lonely has done that for me. And I wouldn’t have realized it if not for a friend asking me that very question.</p>

<p><strong>No place for the lonely</strong><br />
Jesus said there was no place to rest His head and that we were to expect the same. But this doesn’t mean we should settle for loneliness. No, and that is the lie. In fact, His words are even more encouragement to find community and grasp onto it that much harder. We face much adversity in this world, but have no home to run to for shelter from it all. That is, we have no shelter on this cold rock. However, we have our Father and He has given us others to shelter and uphold one another. This is what we have. It is what the Christian life was always meant to be. And we have everything we need.</p>

<p>Inevitably, we will become lonely at one point or another. Friend, it is one of the chief attacks against the body of the Church. Loneliness is not a weakness or sin, but an attack. It is what happens when we are deprived of what we need most on this earth, community. Our greatest need is a healthy relationship with our Father, but as far as things available here, we intrinsically need people. When we don’t seek them out, we will suffer. And what a few long years has taught me, is that this suffering is not to be ignored. Community is important enough that we must be vigilant daily. We must cling to it as our lives depend on it. Without it, we are only partially alive. And this is no life at all. We were not meant to live lonely.</p>

          <h2><a href="/worn-and-tattered-but-praising/">worn and tattered, but praising</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>I feel worn this morning. It’s been a rough week for this journeyer, friends. I’d like to share more about it with y’all, but there’s some wisdom in withholding certain details when your life is as intricately interwoven as mine currently is. That being said, I’m tired and I’ve had a rough week. Emotionally, I’m raw as the week draws to a close and there are some bigger life changes I am on the cusp of making. All this makes an already cold morning, bitter to these frail bones. But, worn as I may be, I want only to do that which doesn’t make sense to me right now. Though worn, I want to shout God’s praises from a mountaintop.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I waited patiently for the Lord; he inclined to me and heard my cry. He drew me up from the pit of destruction, out of the miry bog, and set my feet upon a rock, making my steps secure. He put a new song in my mouth, a song of praise to our God. Many will see and fear, and put their trust in the Lord.” — Psalm 40:1–3</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="the-song-of-theworn">The song of the worn</h4>

<p>It’s when we feel most worn down, beaten, crushed that we need God the most. It’s when I least feel like lifting my heart above the ground which feels ever closer that I need to do so more than usual. Because, it’s when we face adversity and trials that it is easiest to shut down and try to lick our wounds. Maybe we cry out in desperation, but I often couple that with walling myself off from the world. But, look at the words of the psalmist above.</p>

<h4 id="singing-a-newsong">Singing a new song</h4>

<p>Our anguish is turned to praise. Yes, we suffer. But that suffering is not without hope. It is not without the knowledge of the forthcoming. Our darkness is turned light. No longer can we suffer in silence, because our suffering has purpose, though we may not understand it yet. It has meaning. But the purpose and meaning is derived from the Good Shepherd. He is tending His flock, carefully grooming them, watching over us. We are allowed to suffer because God is good, not because we are being tortured.</p>

<h4 id="worn-outpraise">Worn out praise</h4>

<p>It’s on the brink of rescue from my pit that I cannot help but praise my God before you. I’ve been allowed to suffer this week because my Father wants more for me. He wants me to keep pressing on and I am a stubborn son. But, I cannot tell you even now how good He is. I would only defame His love if I began to describe how cared for I feel right now. This may not make any sense to you, but God <em>is</em>. Everything that He’s ever claimed to be, He <em>is</em>. I wish you could experience this with me.</p>

<p>I don’t know where you’re at today, but praise God for it. Maybe you’re worn, frayed, but there is joy to be found in your current state. Wherever you find yourself at this very moment, it is a precious gift tailor made for you. Your Father has hand made each individually for you, His precious child. It’s important that we take a step back and see things more from His point of view every once in a while and say thanks. God is good. It’s time for us all to recognize that for ourselves.</p>

<h4 id="anxious-by-any-othername">Anxious by any other name</h4>

<p>I heard this passage in church yesterday morning and I had to pause. That’s right. I don’t have to do this all on my own. The fate of the world, as I’ve come to reason, does <em>not</em> rest on my shoulders (yes, I’m overly dramatic). He will, as I submit my anxious fears, make my paths straight. But the road isn’t getting any easier.</p>

<h4 id="make-straight-mypaths">Make straight my paths</h4>

<p>What are straight paths? They, first and foremost, are not smooth. They are just as rocky and treacherous as before. Straight refers to orientation. The path will no longer be so meandering. God will get you there and He will do so along a straight line. He will iron out the wrinkles in the road. Life <em>will</em> get easier. But, to a degree.</p>

<h4 id="where-the-rubber-meets-theroad">Where the rubber meets the road</h4>

<p>The words “and do not lean on your own understanding” get me every time. Do I abandon reason? Do I throw my hands up in the air and sit, waiting for God to move me? No. These words are a part of the imperative statement. They emphasize trusting in God. They add focus to the fact that trust is absolute. Anxious or not, God will take care of me. God will not let me down. God will not let Himself down. He has promised to be there for His children. God, the Unchanging One, swore this oath upon Himself. To break it would be to go against the very core of who He is. I may be anxious, but He is infinitely faithful.</p>

<p>Though it seems God is dragging His feet, often it’s because we are dragging ours. I’ve become anxious in my search, therefore I’ve pulled away from my Father, thinking He will let me down like any other person is apt to do. Only, He will not. He has never. And He never will. End of story. So, I wait and I pray. But I act. Prayerfully. Friend, what is making you anxious today? Have you drawn back from your Father like me and tried to carry the burden on your own? There’s another option.</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p>I can’t think of a time I’ve heard anyone complain about their life being too easy. I’ve never heard a person gripe about a lack of strife or obstacles in their life. I myself have complained, however about life being too hard at times. I know people complain about life being tough. And I know there are seasons we’d rather not relive, but when you think about it, wouldn’t you rather life be a little too tough than not tough enough?</p>

<p><strong>We need struggle</strong><br />
I was reading through <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/devotionals/morning-and-evening/2013/03/08">Spurgeon’s Morning devotion</a> last Friday and this began to make sense to me. We need struggle. We need trials; it is our nature to fight. When have you experienced the most growth in your life? I assure you it wasn’t during the golden days of smooth sailing. No, I’m willing to bet it was during the times that God uses most to grab our attention and bring us closer to Himself.</p>

<p><strong>Why do we need struggle?</strong><br />
We need struggle. I get lulled to sleep when things are going well in life. When things go well for an extended period of time, I forget how much I need God. I lose the edge to my dedication. Look at the great men and women of the Bible. They are no exception. In fact, they’re all in their because of struggle. They’re found on the pages marred with strife and adversity. And today we admonish their faith and God’s goodness.</p>

<p><strong>Don’t run</strong><br />
I’m not calling for self-flagellation. I’m not advising we all run around like kamikaze pilots looking to actively make our lives harder. That’s stupid. Instead, I’m advising we not run from it. I’m advising we don’t try and hurry it along or wish it away. Instead, let us work through our struggle with prayer and perseverance. Sure, it hurts. Sure, we are uncomfortable. But, it is only for our good. It is only for our growth. God is not a cosmic malefactor.</p>

<p>There will be struggle in this life, perhaps even more for God’s faithful. Rather than take flight or gripe, we ought to be thankful God cares so much. He goes through painstaking effort to ensure our growth. He has handcrafted each trial for our maximum good. He made us, knows every fiber of our beings and loves us. He allows struggle because of this love and it’s up to us to let it play out it’s divine purpose. Let’s not just expect it, but accept it as a gift from our loving Father. Cheers, friends.</p>

          <h2><a href="/people-life-is-about-the-people/">people. life is about the people</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>In the past three years, I’ve moved six times. I’ve been in four distinct locales. And I’m getting set to move again in the near future. You’d better believe I know that life can get lonely. However, I’ve also lived in a house with six other guys and had the same outcome. It took me some time, but I came to the conclusion that life isn’t about memories or events. It’s about shared experiences. It’s about <em>people</em>. Life is about those surrounding us.</p>

<h4 id="community-was-the-firstchurch">Community was the first church</h4>

<p>People of all walks of life speak of a desire for community and when we look at the definition of community, we find the first church. The last few verses of <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts%202:42-47&amp;version=ESV" title="Acts 2:42-47">Acts 2</a> are where we find the first church. As I read each verse, I see jumping off the page a vision of people, a community, coming together for a common cause (to follow in Jesus’ footsteps) and actually <em>do</em> life. <em>Together</em>. Some have referred to this passage as a form of Communism, and maybe they’re right. But they couldn’t be any farther from the truth as there is no one forcing these people to do anything. Each gave what they had. And freely. I see no coercion here.</p>

<h4 id="community-can-be-dangerous">Community can be dangerous</h4>

<p>Don’t be disillusioned, community isn’t safe. There is danger inherent in sharing your life completely with other people. That is, sharing the deepest, darkest parts of you with other, flawed humans. You will surely hurt them. And they will return the favor. There is gut-wrenching heartache that we all have and will face. But, do you know the flip side? Have you experienced the joy we are bound to encounter?</p>

<h4 id="people-are-cojourners">People are cojourners</h4>

<p>When I move, I will have to find more, but right now I have a couple men who I consider my closest counsel. We each get a little lost sometimes, but we know that we are lost together. We are never without hope. We hurt one another, we hurt with one another. But, at the end of the day, life is better because we know that God is showering down His grace through the presence of the other two. Life gets hard, but knowing that I have two other people right next to me on the path is assurance enough. We each have revealed the darkness within ourselves and together helped make it light. Together, we are coming alive, day by day.</p>

<p>Who are the people in your life? Who are the people that you are willing to take the great risk with? Please don’t say “no one”. For your sake, look, pray, act. We all want community, but there is a slight cost. We cannot live life without people. We were never meant to live apart from community and that means rolling up our sleeves. I implore you, find those people today. There is not a minute to lose.</p>

          <h2><a href="/why-we-need-negative-people-in-our-lives/">why we need negative people in our lives</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>We need negative people in our lives. Let that sink in. To be honest, I hate when someone tells me ‘no’ or that my idea is a bad one. Those of you saying “no idea is a bad one,” have obviously never met me. I come up with several ideas a day. Accumulate those over the period of a month or a year and I’m bound to have one or three bad ideas. Think, now, if I didn’t have someone to provide that perspective. I think you’re beginning to appreciate the negative people (for lack of a better phrase).</p>

<h4 id="negative-people-have-perspective-too">Negative people have perspective, too</h4>

<p>Those telling us ‘no’ aren’t against us. Oftentimes, I need to take a step back to realize this fact. However, these (and I’m loving calling them this) negative people have been put in our lives for a distinct purpose. Maybe they know something we don’t. Maybe they’re trying their best to keep us from making a grave mistake. Their methods may be the <em>worst</em>, but the negative people have a great heart behind their actions. And that’s the most crucial thing we can remember. They are messengers, just as much of a blessing as those carrying good news.</p>

<h4 id="the-negative-people-arent-alwaysright">The negative people aren’t always right</h4>

<p>I’m not saying they’re wrong, but they’re human. Negative people are placed in our lives for a variety of reasons. Sometimes, it’s to keep us from walking off the proverbial cliff. Other times, it’s merely to keep us mindful of the pitfalls. They may help fortify our resolve or they may reveal the folly in it. But whatever the result, it’s our responsibility to listen. Why wouldn’t we listen to those who care enough to speak in love against our course of action. These people deserve a hug or a pat on the back, not the firing squad.</p>

<h4 id="we-dont-like-to-listen-to-negativepeople">We don’t like to listen to negative people</h4>

<p>Simply put, our ideas are an extension of ourselves. For someone to question or reject an idea or thought of ours can feel like a personal attack. I’m sure on some level it is. But it’s not at all. And it is rarely ever meant as such. On top of the attack, the ‘no’ can feel like we’re being told we’re wrong. But that’s not it. It is a reminder that we need people, even negative people, we need <em>community</em>. We need because we don’t have all the answers or the perspective and we never will. But we don’t have to. I can’t imagine that kind of burden.</p>

<p>Maybe I’m just an oversensitive baby, and I’ll accept that charge. But the fact is, negative people, the naysayers can get us all down. The fact of the matter is that they are just as important, just as Godsent as the ones pushing us forward. Because we need them doesn’t mean we stop in our tracks and about face. We listen to their points, take them all into consideration and make a better informed decision, thanking them for their love and care. Because the naysayers are people just like us giving and needing love, in search of true community. So, let’s lay down our weapons and celebrate the negative people in our lives!</p>

          <h2><a href="/running-for-comfort-in-hypocrisy/">running for comfort in hypocrisy</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>I don’t like being wrong. In fact, I hate it. Those of you who know me are undoubtedly chuckling at how true this statement is. The only thing that’s worse is when other people point out that I’m wrong or I need to fix something. A great example is that I’m not a great verbal communicator. Without getting into the reasons, it’s more risky than written and typically gets messier. This morning, I was thinking about a friend and his own lack of communication and how it bothered me. I wanted to address the situation in the near future and realized mid-thought it would only be the pot calling the kettle black. In other words, while I recognize I have the same problem, I found it far easier to ignore the plank in my eye and, in true hypocrisy, point out the splinter in this other person’s. Because, this hypocrisy is far more comfortable.</p>

<p><strong>The smack of imperfection</strong><br />
When it’s not a power play, it really stings to admit imperfection. I have no problem, as I’m sure is the common case, in admitting imperfection when I make a mistake. In fact, it works in my favor to do so. What about when I’m trying to point something out in someone else? What about the times when I’m trying to be right? I don’t see that intrinsic value then. What about when I’m trying to be whole, to recover from a time of profound brokenness? I only want to focus on becoming whole. The hypocrisy shelters me from the perceived defeat or looking back of imperfection.</p>

<p><strong>Bound to imperfection</strong><br />
Imperfection is the only state in which we can take part in community. What?! Take your vision of perfection and supplant them in today’s society. I think you’ll agree that it would not be a pretty sight. On top of that, I know I’m not in danger of coming too close to perfection in any immediate period of time. Maybe you’re different, but I need the imperfect people around me. I need to learn from their lessons. I need to struggle alongside them and I need them to struggle alongside me. Because, while this life is fleeting, the road is long and I need help. In a moment of honesty, I need grace and I need grace in any way that God can spare. If that means it comes through the cracked vessels of friends, family and strangers, then so be it. But community, look at <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts%202&amp;version=ESV" title="Acts 2">Acts 2</a>, even from the beginning it was about people being broken and coming together to make one another and be made whole. And it was beautiful.</p>

<p><strong>The rebound that is brokenness</strong><br />
Honesty, brokenness is the only remedy for a heart shrouded in hypocrisy. That brokenness is defeat, friends, is to believe a great lie. Unfortunately, it’s a lie our culture has grabbed hold of with knuckles, white. Brokenness flies smack dab in the face of the power of one. Brokenness says that I am OK, but I need more, I need a Perfecter, I need community to be well. It says that one is good, but more is best. Brokenness says that I am responsible for my growth and health, but I am not crushed by the astounding burden. There are others who willingly share the weight and I theirs. We are all equal. Beautiful, capable, important. Alas, this is one of the hardest lessons for a culture of vultures.</p>

<p>Friends, I invite you to correct me if I’m wrong, but this culture, of which I am a willing participant, is one steeped in hypocrisy. And to make matters worse, we fight tooth and nail against true repentance, brokenness. We resist brokenness because we have believed that it is weakness, an admission of defeat. And defeat is a chink in the armor we cannot afford. But what if this nation of islands is a violent swing away from true health and ability? What if the true power of the individual is borne of inclusion in the collective? Friends, our true ability is expressed fully only in community. And to be in community, we must be broken and honest. We have to be vulnerable, but that only comes when we’re ready to leave the nest and its comfort of hypocrisy.</p>

          <h2><a href="/the-struggle-for-love/">the struggle for love</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>I have to admit, it’s been a rough week, friends. Honestly, I’m getting a little tired of looking for houses. It’s been a busy week at work and everyone around me seems a little tense. On top of it all, I’m being tested in this tense environment. Yes, this makes for a weary Journeyer. And now that I’ve referred to myself in the third person, this post can continue. Maybe this is my naivety, my inexperience, but I’m asking what it means. What is the purpose of all this struggle?</p>

<p><strong>Struggle isn’t needless</strong><br />
God never forces us to struggle to watch us squirm. In fact, He’s not the one afflicting us. Leaving that conversation for another time, God allows us to struggle always for a very distinct purpose. As our Father, He’s giving us exactly what we need, when we need it. There is nothing that doesn’t have a specific timing or purpose. I, for one, am grateful for this knowledge.</p>

<p><strong>“Like a soldier trudging through the mud”</strong><br />
There have been many days for me that have felt like I am trudging through mud. That’s not what troubles me. It’s the fact that I don’t feel in control; I’m not choosing the destination, nor do I have a clear vision of what it looks like. And there will be more. However, sometimes, it’s best that I don’t know the destination. Most of the time, I’d probably try to avoid it. If I knew the next destination without seeing the grand vista, I’d only seek to thwart it every step of the way. So I trudge.</p>

<p><strong>Love is right over the next hill</strong><br />
Though the journey gets tough, this is what keeps me going. You see, whether it’s in community, parents, friends or God, we really just want love. Struggle often represents an eclipsing of love in our lives. I suppose it could be. But struggle is meant to help us to appreciate the love we’re already receiving <em>that</em> much more. Or it’s meant to awaken us to seek it out once more. Whatever it may be for you, embrace struggle as I’m trying this week. Your prize is waiting for you over the next hill.</p>

<p>Love: it’s what we all need and what we all need to fight for. Without it, this planet is nothing more than a cold, dark rock. But, I can’t imagine God creating life for this purposelessness. No. Love is a struggle and it is <em>the</em> noble struggle. Yes, the struggle is mighty, but the reward beyond compare. Fight friends. Fight, struggle for love and you will never lose. Because you’ll realize that you’re really fighting for God. And He will never lose.</p>

          <h2><a href="/the-fear-of-success/">the fear of success</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>Yes, you’ve read the title correctly. I’m afraid of success. Yes, I’m being serious. This past week was marked by a few landmark decisions in my life, not the least of which is submitting a bid on a house (as in I’m trying to buy it). Believe it or not, my fear at this point isn’t so much the failure, because I know there will be the failure and I know the successful person is one who’s become an old friend of failure. No, my fear is success. What if all goes well? Then what?</p>

<h4 id="god-grantssuccess">God grants success</h4>

<p>It’s no doubt that God grants success. He does so for varying reasons, but for those that love Him, it’s often a reward for faithfulness. I’m all for that, but it’s what comes after that concerns me. It’s probably a lack of experience here, but it’s the risk of complacency that comes with success that I’m referring to here. Look at the great leaders of the past. Many were ruined by their success. And I do not want to be in that company (not that I’ll ever reach that kind of notoriety or infamy, as it may be).</p>

<h4 id="a-battle-forhumility">A battle for humility</h4>

<p>One of the most poignant quotes in the Bible comes from the Roman centurion in <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%208:8-10&amp;version=ESV" title="Matthew 8:8-10">Matthew 8</a> says, “Lord, I am not worthy to have you come under my roof, but only say the word, and my servant will be healed. For I too am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. And I say to one, ‘Go,’ and he goes, and to another, ‘Come,’ and he comes, and to my servant,‘Do this,’ and he does it.” Even Jesus “marveled”. My fear of success is that I will lose sight of this most important fact. No matter how “important” I may become, I am still a man under authority. This will never change. And I never want it to.</p>

<h4 id="im-stillyoung">I’m still young</h4>

<p>Maybe I’m crazy. Just maybe I’m the only one out there with this strange fear. I can accept that. I’m not saying I never want to succeed, that’s just sadistic. I’m saying that I don’t ever want to get too big. And I have reassurance of this, “For by the grace given to me I say to everyone among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think, but to think with sober judgment, each according to the measure of faith that God has assigned.” (<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%2012:3&amp;version=ESV" title="Romans 12:3">Romans 12:3</a>). I know that God will never give me more than He intended me to handle, because with power comes great responsibility. Maybe I’m ready to take some of that on, but I don’t want to underestimate the inherent responsibility.</p>

<p>Failure can only take us so far, but it’s success that can truly blindside a person. It’s the golden years that have seen the best and brightest fall. It’s when times are good that the most faithful wander. I’ve seen and I’ve tasted; I know God is good. And if that means compromising success and wealth for Him, then I will choose to forgo. Yes, it’ll be a hard decision, but I cannot think of a life without Life. I cannot think of an existence without the love and provision of my God. How about you?</p>

          <h2><a href="/i-am-a-fraud/">i am a fraud</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>I suppose it’s posting time once more. I’d love to come up with some topic off the top of my head and start writing about it, but there’s something far more weighty I feel I have the responsibility to get off my chest. Rather than qualifying, I will just say it: I am a fraud. This blog over the past few months has not been what I claim it to be. The tagline reads “Honest conversation about God, love, faith, community.” The only thing honest about it have been my thoughts on the topics put forth. This may not strike you as problematic, but the real fact is that I’ve not been honest about myself. I’ve hidden myself behind my words and this, my friends, is the first step toward a lie. For this, I’m terribly sorry. You deserve more.</p>

<p><strong>The fear</strong><br />
For one to run and hide, there must first be a fear, a lie from which they’re running. Mine is a fear of being known by perfect strangers and rejected for what they find to be ugly. Yes, I’m really afraid that once y’all figure out who I really am down deep, you’ll turn and run, rejecting the very core of me. There is no greater rejection than this and rather than give you the chance to wound me so deeply, I, like the armadillo, hid underneath my thick shell. But, at the end of the day, I recognize this fear is nothing more than a lie. I realize it is little more than an attempt to keep me from fulfilling my purpose. And as the sole writer of this blog currently, I have to apologize for failing in my responsibility to you, my friend and reader.</p>

<p><strong>The lie</strong><br />
Who can reject a soul, but someone who knows intimately that soul? Herein lies the crux of the lie I’ve believed for most of my life. While my writing is very near and dear to my heart, a reader’s rejection of it isn’t an intrinsic rejection of who I am. This is true for any art or avenue of creation. Rejection is merely that of the specific piece, not the creator. Even if it is meant to tear down the person, there is hardly a soul on earth that knows this person’s heart. If there is no one who knows intimately this person, then how can the reject outright? I’ve not been rejected. I’ve not been rejected in any way. And I will not be truly rejected.</p>

<p><strong>The approval</strong><br />
Daily I am learning to find my identity in the approval that’s been there since before I was ever conceived. The Truth is that I am loved and accepted. The Truth is that I always have been and always will be. I hide from phrases such as this, but my soul needs it: my identity comes from the God who has given me a name, a home and love. My identity is secured by a Savior, Jesus Christ, who shed His blood willingly because He found my soul beautiful and worthy. What do the opinions of mere mortals matter? Yet, I struggle mightily with this. Every day is a battle for faith. Every day, I grapple to believe in Love.</p>

<p>I’m sorry, friends. I’ve hidden my struggle from you for too long. I want to share my triumphs with you, but to hide my struggles is a sham. Just as yourselves, I am working out my faith as we speak. And I will continue to do so. I will do so in plain sight from now on. I owe it to you for your faithful readership. I value each view, I truly do. Each one of you makes this discipline worth it. So, I will do my part as well. I will continue to struggle with you, before you. But I do not struggle for freedom. I struggle because I am free. I hope to continue to see each one of you as we continue down this wayward journey.</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p>Many, if not all of us, are waiting right now for something. Whether it’s a new job, a first job, a person, there’s an opportunity on which we’ve set our sights. But, I’ll admit it’s easy to begin to believe all too soon that God is no longer for us in our pursuit. After the first couple weeks of dogged application filling, we get weary and tired. God, are you there? I thought You’d led me to make this decision, to follow this path. Now, You’ve forsaken me. I’m dying here, stagnating and where are You? Nowhere. The silence only reaffirms our heart’s growing panic. But, He’s forgotten nothing. No, He’s busy saving you from each of those opportunities. And you can help.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Look carefully then how you walk, not as unwise but as wise, 16 making the best use of the time, because the days are evil. — Ephesians 5:15–16</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Days can’t be evil</strong><br />
No, days are not being referred to as demons running around your calendar. But, the passage notes how easy it is to waste days of our lives. It takes effort. It takes patience, trust. It takes work. There’s plenty to be done in the waiting. Most of the time, what I’ve found is it just takes allowing God a little latitude to do a little house cleaning in our hearts. Most of the time, we are not at a place where we could appreciate or take advantage of a new opportunity were it served to us on a silver platter. And we, we can be walking faithfully into that darkness with Him.</p>

<p><strong>You’re being saved</strong><br />
As I mentioned, most likely God is saving you from some unfortunate outcome. Either the opportunity is not for you or you are not meant for that scenario on some level. There is a snare hidden in the great luscious plains of the opportunity and you’ve been spared falling its victim. There is a cliff around a blind corner down the road that He stopped you from traveling any further. But because we don’t have that foreknowledge, all we see is God halting our progress. All we see is God holding us back. And we lash out like the children we are.</p>

<p><strong>There is a plan</strong><br />
I’ve spent much of my life wasted on waiting for many things, women in particular. In each, despite my ignorance, God took me somewhere in the waiting. He brought me a bit closer to Him in spite of my insistence on staying in the desert of my childishness. But there have been those times that I’ve waited praying and getting to know better my Father and I’ve been greatly tested in these times. For a few months, I was stretched beyond what I thought myself possible, but I prayed. There are few times in my life that have been more rewarding. There are few times when I’ve felt more in tune with God. Yes, there were the impatient cries out in the night and the discomfort of confronting demons with whom I’d become well acquainted over some years, but I would not trade that time for anything. And that time without doubt is integral to who and where I am now.</p>

<p>Friend, for what or whom do you wait? Do you wait alone in painful silence or are you waiting with the Father? Do you feel Him for you or against you in this time? I don’t know how to convince you, but I assure you He is for you. Oh, how He is for you. In the waiting, will you go out on a limb and trust in that? Will you work with Him and experience the pain that leads to renewal of the soul you so desperately need? Don’t worry, the pain is fleeting, but His joy lasts. We have so few days on this planet. Let’s make the most of them. Every last one.</p>

            <blockquote>
  <p>I perceived that there is nothing better for them than to be joyful and to do good as long as they live; also that everyone should eat and drink and take pleasure in all his toil — this is God’s gift to man. — Ecclesiastes 3:12–13</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>So, not to rub it in for any of you, I saw Mumford and Sons last night. The music was outstanding. The show was phenomenal. Now, I do love the band, but that wasn’t the reason I so enjoyed myself. It wasn’t the fact that they’re incredible performers as well as musicians. No, it’s because they were having the times of their lives up on stage right before my very eyes. They were having a blast. <em>I</em>, therefore, was having a blast. And, in the best way, their albums are ruined for me. The experience was that memorable.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>What about us?</strong><br />
Do you enjoy your day job? Do you take pride in your work? If you’re like me, not enough. Maybe you don’t at all, I’m not judging. But, work isn’t a punishment of the Fall. It wasn’t something that came about <em>after</em> the forbidden fruit. God gave Adam and Eve the tasks of cultivating the Garden and subduing the earth. Adam and Eve were pretty hardcore, actually. Somehow, today we no longer view work as essential to our existence. Bane, maybe, but certainly not essential, let alone joyful. This, my friends, is a travesty.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Work has a purpose</strong><br />
God gave us work because it allows us to exercise the God in all of us. It gives us the ability to create, take responsibility and care for the world around us. We need our work to provide a space in our lives to do all this regularly. Otherwise, we become complacent, unfulfilled, lazy. Friends, we’re wasting away. No, we don’t need to all become international rock stars. The solution is far simpler than that.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>The heart of work</strong><br />
It’s time we looked at work in a new light. Yes, work is necessary to survive, but as I’ve said, that’s not it’s only purpose, nor it’s most important. How does your job enable you to create today? Maybe all you do is file, but did you know you were creating organization out of chaos? You work at lost luggage, but you’re helping restore order, creating a new state of equilibrium for all those disgruntled customers. In every job, there is an element of creating. The question is: does that method of creating match your heart? Are you creating in a way that you feel (or <em>could</em> feel) proud of?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’m not a rock star, nor will I likely ever be and I’m alright with that fact. I will probably never be known worldwide and that’s fine. The point is that I’m fulfilled in what I do from nine to five, or eight to four, or whatever shift you may work. The point is that I’m taking pride in what I’ve accomplished each day, because this fulfillment is God’s gift of work. If we are not enjoying, it is either our perspective or this is not the job for us. Only you can answer this. But remember: <em>work is a gift</em>.</p>

          <h2><a href="/directionally-challenged-3bfdc708f07/">directionally challenged</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>So, you remember that post I wrote last week about <a href="http://104.193.143.57/~waywar13/ce/2013/02/07/letting-go/" title="Letting Go">letting go</a>? Well, I think I had to face on of my greatest fears in writing this blog and lived that post a little this past weekend. While I hope you picked up on the jest, I wasn’t kidding about the having to let go some myself. I’m looking to buy a place of my own right now and I went to an open house for a place that I thought coming in was so-so, but the location was nearly perfect. I was thinking I could fix up the place, I <em>want</em> to fix up a place, if it wasn’t by some stretch of the imagination terribly undervalued, but not even that could keep my interest. There were just some aspects of the place that I couldn’t get over. And not that coin operated laundry is a big deal, but come on, I have to have <em>some</em> standards. Even if they’re strange or low. But what good are standards if I don’t really know the purpose of the endeavor?</p>

<p><strong>Direction determines destination</strong><br />
Look, I’m only twenty-five. I know I don’t need to have the world figured out yet, but I recall three words that were said to me in college by a man far wiser than I wanted to give him credit. While I may not know the destination (because who can accurately predict with any certainty?), I need some direction. I need to take some steps along a path in that heading. In other words, <em>I need a plan</em>. Without this, I can only float along without any sense of direction or accomplishment as I have no clue where I am in regards to any other significant landmarks and I can’t much compare with the start as I am closer to nothing, only farther from the starting. Without direction, priorities cannot be. As priorities alone carry no weight. It’s the long term, the destination that grants them weight.</p>

<p><strong>Direction over destination</strong><br />
As I said in my earlier aside, who can accurately predict the future? Just because we have put ourselves on the road to a destination doesn’t mean the path won’t wind around, doesn’t mean there might not be road work or a blockage up ahead. I only means we are moving toward our destination. However, it gives us a means of measuring progress, a certain assurance we are going in the desired direction and a way of estimating when we’ll get there. Life isn’t certain. Nothing in this world is guaranteed. Who’s to say the road isn’t impassable and all other routes to that destination don’t require too costly a detour? Who’s to say that our destination today matches what’s important to us tomorrow? This is why the direction must matter more than the destination.</p>

<p><strong>You won’t get there</strong><br />
Up until now, it’s sounded like I’m telling you you’ll never reach your destination. Once again, nothing is absolute. I can’t say that. However, by focusing on the steps along the way and picking our heads up intermittently to verify, we are setting ourselves up far more to reach our destination than otherwise. And without a destination, there is nowhere we are getting, so how can we ever arrive? Let’s face it, we’re all growing and learning as we must. Our understanding of ourselves, God, the world is ever-changing. At some point, you’ll find that your destination no longer matches who you are or what you stand for. Some point, you may even reach that destination. Now what? You pick another point on the map and you keep walking. To stay would be to allow complacency and complacency is a painfully slow death.</p>

<p>Friends, you are living a story, but not just any, <em>yours</em>. As with any good story, there must be a plot and a plot is based around some sort of trek or journey with a destination. However, what makes the story is not the destination and it certainly isn’t the beginning. It’s the journey itself. It’s the pain and joy, love and defeat the character incurs along the way. Reaching the destination is merely the icing on the cake. Why should our stories be any different? Why should our stories be any less captivating and enthralling? To say they should be would only insult a God who is captivating and adventurous. And isn’t He writing the bigger Story in which each of ours takes place?</p>

          <h2><a href="/letting-go/">letting go</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>I can think of many things that I hold onto in life. Hands, memories, relationships, grudges. But I can’t think of too many things I’ve let go over the years. I want to wonder why. I want to steal away into the wilderness and contemplate long and hard without distraction until I’ve come to the root of this. However, I know that’s just my dramatic side coming out. I know that deep down, the cause is readily apparent. I think you have an idea of what lies underneath as well. So, come with me and explore.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.” — Matthew 11:28–29</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>What’s so heavy?</strong><br />
I don’t think if I can read this passage enough. Nearly every day seems like another attempt to pile on some more emotional baggage or physical burden on top of the mountain on my back. With each sunrise comes new mercy, but also the possibility to overextend myself further. If I stay busy, then I’m important. The busier I am, the more important I am as well. Also, with busyness comes a sense of control. I’ve chosen to keep busy with this set of activities and they take up most or all of my time. Therefore, I am in control and my life is on track. Yes, but so was the Titanic.</p>

<p><strong>I’m strong enough</strong><br />
I’m sure you are strong enough. But for how long? See, we don’t know the true strength of anything until it’s broken and oftentimes irreparable. You and I may be strong enough today, but I don’t want to wait till the day when I find out that’s no longer true. I don’t want to find out after that I can no longer be fixed. I don’t want to find our it’s too late. And what is it that I’m trying to prove, anyway?</p>

<p><strong>What means this “rest”?</strong><br />
Sure, I didn’t sleep all that well last night, but surely I don’t want to be put out to pasture. That’s not at all what is meant here. In my quest for control and security, I’m never done. Always striving for more. Frantic. It’s from <em>this</em> that Jesus here is promising rest. It’s from the rat race He promises to deliver. It’s from the weariness of a heart always seeking and never finding that He saves. See, no longer do we need to increment our control over the world around us. We have another who is for us, kind and loving and far more capable who’s won this battle already for us. But, herein lies the catch-22 of our need for control.</p>

<p><strong>The vice of control</strong><br />
Control, like greed, begs us to always strive for more. We are never content with the degree of which we’ve attained. For us to give up control, we need to feel a sense of control in the transfer. we need a little security. How can we be secure in a God we cannot see or feel? This question only reveals my blindness. No, I cannot see God with my eyes, nor can I feel Him with my fingertips. But, I can see Him, feel Him, experience Him with my soul. As can you. With our hearts we can reach right out and touch Him. It’s because of all this I know He is good. It’s because of what I’ve seen, felt and experienced in my heart that I am certain He is good and loving. It’s because of all this that I’m finding security in letting go, giving up.</p>

<p>There are so many things in our lives today that augment our sense of control. I fear these words fall on deaf ears, yet I must speak. I’ve grown tired of always more. I’ve become weary of the ever-increasing burden of control. I no longer wish to take it all. I suspect some of you are feeling similarly. It’s time you came to reckoning with the goodness and love of our Father. He wants to give you rest and peace. There are no strings attached. There is no catch. He wants your best. And that best is Him loving you. Our accepting that only starts with our <em>letting go</em>.</p>

          <h2><a href="/never-be-ready/">never be ready</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>I was traveling up to Pennsylvania this weekend to visit my cohorts Erik and Jon. I’d decided to give the bus a try and maybe an hour into the ride, I’d realized I’d made a new friend. How the conversation with this new acquaintance took the turn it did, I don’t know but within an hour, we were sharing life stories. We were talking about love and doubt, success and fear. However, he shared with me a phrase that has stuck with me: “Relish today. You can always catch up tomorrow.” If you’re thinking to yourself I’ve done jumped ship and hopped aboard the “live for the moment/free love” train, you’re wrong. If you ascribe to that, you might also want to gut out this post with me.</p>

<p><strong>The heart of Life is good</strong><br />
This is the underlying truth that we first have to accept if we are to relish the day. We have to accept, not just recite, that the heart of Life, God, is good. We must let down our torches and weapons and allow Him to convince us He is for us. We have to believe that as a Christ follower, His Spirit lives within us and everyday we are becoming more in touch and in tune with that Spirit. We must allow for a shadow of a doubt that our perceived failure is the grace to experience growth and learning. We have to trust that we are not alone and that no matter the outcome, God is granting us success when we make the effort to live freely under His authority. But, He’s given us the ability to know His heart with the beating of our own and we have to trust that kindredship as well.</p>

<p><strong>What is failure?</strong><br />
My greatest obstacle in this pursuit is the fear of failure. I am so afraid to fail that I often fail to act at all. I seize up. Without going into the root causes (as that is a post in and of itself, if not a book), I had to stop and realize this weekend that it is my definition of failure that often holds me back. Failure isn’t <em>not</em> achieving a desired outcome. Failure is incurring hardship (as we most certainly do and often) and refusing to grow and learn from it. Failure isn’t all short of success, but it is stagnation. And my fear of failure was leading me smack dab into it <em>every</em> time.</p>

<p><strong>The dusty lens</strong><br />
You may feel that God’s will for your life is clear as mud today. You know what, it probably is. However, through reading His word, experiencing community amongst others with a similar pursuit and applying what we are learning, that is how our understanding becomes clearer. Sure, we will make colossal mistakes and more than once. They will hurt, both us and our loved ones. Yet, we must. Because this is how we learn. This is how we grow and mature. And we must continue growing. <br />
We need to allow ourselves the latitude as well as the framework to do so. Our latitude is accepting mistakes as necessary. Our framework is our faith and growing understanding of our great Father. This is how we clean our lenses.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“We’ll never be ready if we keep waiting for the perfect time to come. Won’t be steady, we’ll never be ready.<br />
Where we don’t know, though we can’t see, just walk on down this road with me. Won’t be steady, we’ll never be ready.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fear and the fear of failure only come from a poor understanding of the Father. He is for us. He is with us. And He is not speaking in riddles. We are His children and as children, we do not understand fully because we are not capable, so we will misstep. We will fall down, hurt ourselves and become a crying mess. But, he dusts us off and shows us that falling doesn’t hurt as badly as we thought on the way down. Those missteps aren’t failure. They’re God’s grace being given to us to teach us more about ourselves and, more importantly, Himself. Though it hurts, it’s the only way we’ll ever learn the hard lessons (and you know it). We just have to allow ourselves to experience those teaching moments. We have to live in the moment and accept that there will be mistakes. Otherwise, we’ll never be ready.</p>

If you’re familiar with this song, you’ll probably remember there’s a line in that people in the Church didn’t find quite…couth.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So Heaven meets earth like a sloppy wet kiss…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’d be willing to bet those words probably don’t quite sit well with you either. But, I’ve come to realize this is an indicator of a very sad reality. We can’t imagine a God, our Father, greeting us the way a father would upon reunion with his long-lost son or daughter. We far underestimate His love and our worship is a mirror of this tragic fact.</p>

<p><a href="http://open.spotify.com/track/6ntyEDNigtyjxLTlicYwEv" title="Build Your Kingdom Here by Rend Collective">“Build Your Kingdom Here” by Rend Collective</a><br />
Give this song a listen. What do you hear? I hear a headlong crashing of the gates of Heaven. I hear the earnest cry of a people desperate for God’s presence, to draw closer to the Father. It almost feels like a strain of worship erupting from a throng of people reaching a near raucous state. Most of all, it’s visceral and heartfelt. There’s little orchestration. It’s not measured and sterile. It’s real.</p>

<p><strong>Bashing the Worship Leaders</strong><br />
No, I’m not criticizing anyone. I’m challenging everyone, however. We sing a lot of songs that sound beautiful a hundred/thousand/many thousands of voices strong. But, oftentimes when you drown out the noise, the worship falls flat. Why? There is no heart behind it all. Worship isn’t an extension of our joy in Christ, but merely a half-hour block of time allotted to standing and singing the songs everyone has come to know by heart. This, my friends, makes us no better than Cain. Our offering, though it appears to meet the requirements, is only for show, meaningless.</p>

<p><strong>Hearts on Fire</strong><br />
What would it sound like for a church full of people to offer worship that sprung up like Old Faithful from the heart? What would that violent, possibly ugly, eruption look like? I guarantee it wouldn’t be as composed as our traditional worship today. But, any parent would know that the heartfelt finger paintings of a child are worth more than their weight in gold. Maybe we’ve forgotten to whom we’re singing. Maybe our hearts’ fires have been quenched by the extinguishing of the ravenous nature of God’s love in our minds. We’ve lost sight of God’s whelming love.</p>

<p><strong>We, you and me, are God’s most beloved creation.</strong> Allow me to reiterate, <em>we</em> are God’s favorite part of <em>all</em> creation. If God, who is Love, loves us more than all else, how much are we loved? There aren’t words in any tongue that encompass this thought. We are loved with a love that surpasses the number of stars in the universe. Can we not muster a heartfelt, unabashed offering of worship to this great Father every once in a while? Is that too much? Do we really have a hard time imagining a God who loves us in this visceral way? We shouldn’t.</p>

          <h2><a href="/bombs-to-the-soul/">bombs to the soul</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>For those of you that know me, I’m a bit of a show-off. Not necessarily in a big way, but there’s no doubt that I’m trying to get someone’s attention in just about every setting. I caught myself in this mindset in the middle of worship Sunday. I tried to suppress it, but I couldn’t let it go. So, once the sermon began, I took my mark and started off down the rabbit hole of this new rediscovery. This post is about where that rabbit hole took me and the question we all have to answer at some point or another.</p>

<p><strong>The Day the Bomb Dropped</strong><br />
The day the first bomb (that I can remember) dropped on my soul was somewhere around the age of three or four. I’d lied about something trivial, but out of fear of my obviously displeased father, I’d tried to placate him the quickest and simplest way my little brain knew how. I lied and I lied and I lied. I lied through my teeth; I lied to his face. While I don’t remember much of the build up, I do remember the punch line and to this day it’s haunted me like an ever-present specter of the soul. My recollection of this event ends with the words “I’m disappointed in you.” Right then and there, the war for my soul began. And I was completely unaware.</p>

<p><strong>Lost Boy</strong><br />
Ever since, I’ve had please, had to earn my keep, had to prove my worth. Every interaction is fraught with this grave insecurity. Every word is dripping with this fear of inadequacy. My life has been characterized by nothing more than a fear of rejection and failure. And on Sunday, when the the question was asked as my head was spinning, the words sliced through the years of painful silence like a surgeon’s knife: “Do you remember that first hurt, the first time you were told you were a disappointment, incapable, not enough?” (or something like that.) It was at that moment I saw myself, twenty years younger, trapped inside wanting only to be told he was valued, he was cherished. I’ve been waiting to be someone’s beloved and I’ve only been hurt that much deeper. I’ve been lost all my life.</p>

<p><strong>Bringing the Dead to Life</strong><br />
The road ahead is one many cities have faced after wartime. It’s one many men and women have endeavored successfully before me. I’ve identified what is dead, has been for some time, and needs to be brought back to life through embracing the truth. I am and will continue to walk through this with my parents, asking for their help and advice along the way. And I know I’m fortunate that they both are more than willing to dole out both. However, ultimately, I need to seek the truth of my Father. It’s time I embrace fully the analogy my dad has provided for the true Father. While I carry my dad’s last name and the name my parents gave to me, my name was written out for me before time by my Father. I was His beloved son before I was ever a twinkle in anyone’s eye. And I’ve never disappointed anyone really, but especially not Him. He’s always been and always will be proud of who He’s made me.</p>

<p>Where do you find yourself today, dear friend? Are you downcast? Are you demoralized from years or even decades of bombs being dropped on your soul? Have you given up worth? Take heart. You were never made to think so lowly of yourself. Reject this lie today. Embrace the Love that has always been there for you as I’m finding out myself. There are pitfalls in life. There are snares and bombs. While I won’t deny any of this, there has also always been your Father. His love is wider, deeper, longer and broader than any crater that can be blown in your heart or any hole into which you can fall. He’s been waiting to tell you about His love. Desperately. What’s been holding you back? Does it still need to?</p>

          <h2><a href="/tired-of-missing-out/">tired of missing out</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>I think I’ve always been characterized as careful and cautious. Some of the earliest stories my parents tell me about myself involve this characterization. I’ve kind of stayed this way over the years and it’s carried into my faith. My caution is to the point of causing paralysis at times even in the most benign of situations.See, not only am I overly cautious, but I’m a control freak. When I don’t feel I have that control, I freeze and my cautious nature is kicked into overdrive. You see, I’m afraid of missing out; <em>I’m afraid of being wrong</em>. So, I don’t act. At all.</p>

<p><strong>The most important step of faith</strong><br />
Simply, I contend, it is to <em>take one</em>. How many times have I misstepped? How many times have I not taken a step in love? Too many for me to recount. However, I am still here to tell you and tell you that God is good through it all. There is no step you can take from which He cannot bring you back. Now, I urge some wisdom in your actions, but that will grow in time spent in God’s word. Maybe I’m still wet behind the ears, but we were made to do. We were made to conquer and to fall down, but ultimately carry out the will of our gracious Father.</p>

<p><strong>We’re missing the point</strong><br />
If you’re anything like me, your motivation is to <em>not</em> misstep. This constant looking back often gets me lost. I fail to use the eyes in the back of my head to see what’s upcoming and stumble on the smallest of stones. Maybe you grow those eyes when you become a parent, I don’t know, but this strategy isn’t working out for me. Rather than focus on the goal, I’m wary of its antithesis and even the most well placed step can cause me to question as I’ve lost sight of where it is compared to the true destination.</p>

<p><strong>We’re missing out</strong><br />
We’ve become so accustomed to control in this day and age that even trivial decisions can feel monumental. Ordering at a restaurant can cause stress for even the most put together people (I’m kidding…a little). I think you see where I’m going with this. I don’t fully understand it, but our need to not miss out is having quite the opposite effect on our lives. By my overanalysis in trying to experience the most from any given set of options, I end up missing out on most or all of them. My inaction often stalls me long enough that the decision will pass without my having made one. Yet, that in and of itself is a decision. And then I’m <em>completely</em> miserable.</p>

<p>Maybe I’m speaking in youth, but the times in life I’ve missed out have typically stemmed from inaction. However, the greatest faith experiences have come from acting when I was less than completely sure. But, this is precisely what faith is. Faith is acting with an element of the unknown lingering. It is uncertainty in the midst of experience and information. Faith is that haystack with the needle. Sure, there’s a needle and you may get pricked, but it’s also a large haystack. I don’t know about you, but I’m tired of missing out rolling around in that hay.</p>

            <p>As often happens, I found myself in the middle of a sermon this past Sunday, my mind miles from the strict content being conveyed. It was about spiritual warfare, a term maybe not all of us are familiar with. However, I know that is not so with the word “sin”. To oversimplify, spiritual warfare is the pursuit to remove sin from one’s life and keep it at bay. I think we all associate sin as bad and could come up with a reason or two that spiritual warfare might be a noble pursuit. However, in our reasoning, I’m going out on a limb and saying that we’re all vastly missing the mark here. Simply put, the cost of sin, of disobeying or rebelling against God, is too great.</p>

<p><strong>The wages of sin is death.</strong> Yes, I’ve just hit you over the head with the theological hammer. However, it has to be said. If God is the Giver of Life, Life Himself, the Creator and our Father, anything falling short of Him is…well, death. Because, half-live people running around is just ridiculous. I mean, where do we make the cutoff (you can laugh now)? But seriously, any rebellion against Life or its Originator must be that which is other than life, i.e., death. And I’m not referring only to “off with his head!” death, I’m also referring to a slow death of the heart. You know, that feeling of being calloused down deep? Yeah, that’s what I’m talking about, friend.</p>

<p><strong>God is our Father.</strong> I don’t know your background, but if it was anything like mine (and I had a great childhood), you’re missing this linchpin in the matter. What does a perfect Father look like? What kind of love does this Father bestow upon His beloved children? Did you even know you were His beloved? Did you know He bled for you? Did you know He cries out for your heart even now? Maybe you find God to be an evil puppet master pulling your strings, causing you one heartbreak after another. He’s not the cause of your heartbreak. In fact, it’s His absence that is breaking your heart. It’s your unknowing your Father that is ripping your heart to shreds. It’s how you’ve cut off the One by whom you are named. He loves you. He wants you and your beautiful, albeit wayward and tainted, heart back. Don’t believe me? I am there right now. And I know these words to be true as I type them.</p>

<p><strong>Battle without a cost.</strong> There cannot be a battle without a cost. And that cost is ever-increasing with our growing acceptance of this perfect Love. We are loved far beyond imagination, far beyond compare. As our eyes are opened, we become more fully aware of what we choose to give up when we sin; we become more aware of what it is we’re really fighting for, friends. And fight we must. However, a warrior without a cause is a terrible waste. We have a cause, the most valuable and costly the world will ever see. It’s imperative we constantly seek to understand that cause every day. Will you join me in fighting for this love?</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p>What do this recent New York Times article on <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/fashion/the-end-of-courtship.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0">dating</a>, the doctrine of all male clergy and I all have in common? Simply, they are all examples of men needing to step up to the plate today. They all exemplify ways in which men have been letting down the rest of the world, yes, the women. Allow me to explain.</p>

<p><strong>What is dating anymore?</strong> I’d agree from personal experience that dating has devolved into a mutant form of speed dating set up by a series of texts or quick emails to do nothing more than hang out impersonally with another person and expediently check off the boxes in our heads before our attention spans run out. They’re shallow, maybe fun, but ultimately flawed. It’s not about connection, but compatibility based on a mental checklist. And, many men are allowed to simply float along the dating pool as women, frustrated by the abundant boyish passivity, take the reins of the relationship (for the however few minutes the “date” lasts). Then, rinse and repeat.</p>

<p><strong>Why can’t women be pastors?</strong> I struggled with this question only a few weeks ago. I bristled at the inequity. But, after prayer, reading and a great conversation with a man infinitely more mature than myself, it made sense. Women, it’s not about you. It’s about God. It’s the Father raising His boys into men. Women, we know you can lead. You typically make better CEO’s, managers, etc. That’s not the point. What is, however, is the need to challenge men to leadership. Look back at the Fall in Eden. Adam’s sin really is passivity. I see this in droves in my own life. I see it all around me. Some of the strongest people I know and in the Bible are women. However, it’s the men who really need help here. That’s the idea. Call the men (boys at the time of their calling) up to positions of leadership. Ladies, our boyish hearts need it. Adventure and responsibility are the best “Miracle-Gro” for our souls.</p>

<p><strong>I just like talking about myself.</strong> Those are the words floating around my head, but I bring up myself not to speak of only myself. I’m reading John Eldredge’s <em>The Way of the Wild Heart</em> and I realize my struggles with passivity, validation, purpose are very real, but I am not alone. I am but a wave in a vast ocean of boys cut down in their youth. This is not a gripe, but a mere fact of this existence. We, men, are at war. We are being targeted before we are aware of the conflict, so that when we realize the true state of things, we are overwhelmed and give up. Yes, I’ve faced setbacks throughout my life and I’m still a bit off of center, but I’ve also seen the greater truth. If we didn’t face hardship, we’d have no need for a Father to run to. If we had no need for a Father, then God would be of no use to us. Maybe I’m weak, but I do need a Father, I need <em>the</em> Father. And I know now that He has been growing me into a man from day one. I’ve been unready to be a son.</p>

<p>Men, I think I’ve given three good examples of where we need to step up. Now, I give you a why: there’s a majority of the population that we’re letting down. Sure, we’re CEOs, politicians, managers, etc. but are we good friends, husbands, sons? I’d argue that oftentimes, no. Do we care for the women in our lives in ways that matter to them, like cherishing them, encouraging them, making them feel as beautiful as they are? No. Are we living up the the example put forth by our Father? Are we walking in the footsteps of Jesus? Think about it. Women, I’m sorry. We need to do better, if only for your sakes. Men, it’s time we <em>man up</em>.</p>

          <h2><a href="/death-without-purpose/">death without purpose</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>I went to my first funeral Saturday (yes, <em>first</em>). It was for my grandpa’s twin brother (identical). I can say authoritatively I do not like funerals. I like them less the closer to my nuclear family they come. It scared me to think that will by my own grandpa soon enough. It scared me enough to continue wondering what a life of purpose looked like. So, I joked with those around me and laughed, but inwardly I was churning. Sunday reminded me why I’m glad I go to church. With Sunday’s message came the realization of the alternative to purpose and thus the reason for purpose. It brought some solace for a heart learning to grieve.</p>

<p><strong>Purpose manifests itself in action.</strong> A purposed life is one displaying purpose through its works. The man or woman of purpose isn’t content with merely believing their calling, but daily taking steps in its direction. This life isn’t idle, but active even in waiting. The purposed wait actively through prayer. The purposed are active in prayer. How can this be?</p>

<p><strong>Purpose has a source.</strong> If we believe God to be Sovereign over all, the Maker, then we believe Him to be the Source. Is He not also the source of purpose? There can be no following a purpose if we do not go back to its Originator and constantly clarify and rediscover its path. Just because we’ve been given a map doesn’t mean we are instantly navigational experts. We need someone who has traveled the route once before. We need someone to show us the way. Here is the beauty: not only do we have access to the Source of life and its purpose, but we also have a great high priest who has been all along this path before us (Hebrews 4:14–16). It’s up to us to ask for clarity whenever we need it and <em>confidently</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Death without purpose.</strong> Life without purpose is anything but life. Purpose is the soul’s lifeblood. Living a purposeful life is merely to express the beating of our heart. However, the air our soul so desperately needs is prayer and spiritual encouragement. And so, our souls must breathe for our hearts to continue to beat. Friends, I’ve told you before I don’t like funerals. Just because you’re not in a casket doesn’t mean you’re alive. No, <em>purpose</em> does.</p>

<p>As a young man finally tasting life for the first time, I cannot go back to the bitterness of death in which I lived before. Nor can I stand by and idly watch those around me wallow in shades of death. We were granted life long ago, but for the sake that we might live it vibrantly (John 10:10b). An early death has never fit anyone well. So, let us live today truly. Let there be no ambiguity that we are indeed alive. And let there be no confusion from where that life springs. Life is only such when lived in purpose. All else is death.</p>

            <p><strong>Changing the world is hard work.</strong> There is a reason why few people throughout history have been able to achieve this. It takes a lot of focus. It takes vigilance, perseverance and resolution. Needless to say, it’s been a tough week. Tough in the sense that I find myself constantly having to resist apathy. However, it’s more than apathy. The greatest enemy of a world changer, of men in particular, is passivity. Here is where I struggle mightily.</p>

<p><strong>Let me sleep in one more minute.</strong> I liken Monday to the day the alarm went off inside me. When I got to work, it was time to awaken and engage the world around me. No, I didn’t want to. I wanted to sit in my office, let the conversations that would come to me and control my interaction that way. This isn’t world change. So, I took a few minutes and wandered into a couple conversations. That was my caffeine for the day (I like coffee too much for this to be literal, friends). I felt awake and alive. So, for the rest of the day I intermittently talked with various people around the office.</p>

<p><strong>A smile.</strong> Tuesday I had a meeting and leaving this meeting, one of my coworkers said, “I like how you’re always smiling.” People notice. When we are engaged, even if only a tad (as in my case) it is evident. And all it takes is a smile. If even I can muster a smile most of the time, I think we all can do the same from time to time. Honestly, what is so heavy that would have us perpetually frowning?</p>

<p><strong>A thought.</strong> I can’t imagine Jesus was immune from the struggle to remain focused each day. I find it so easy to go an entire work day without so much as a second thought, let alone a real prayer. This is important, because it’s through prayer that we ask to be refilled with the Spirit each day and throughout the day. It’s only through this power that I’ve noticed a difference this week. It’s not me. I’ve seen what I do and it looks nothing like engagement. It’s passive and apathetic. Jesus, powerful as He was on earth, relied on the Spirit’s strength. Why shouldn’t we?</p>

<p><strong>Our worlds need us.</strong> I’m going to beat this horse till it’s six feet in the ground, friends. Our worlds are not ours unless we’re engaged in them. Otherwise, we are merely audience members to someone else’s story. My friends, that is hell. That is death. We have been given life and given it to the full. Let’s live. Let’s be alive, fully. Let’s follow the example of Christ and rely completely on the Spirit. Then, let’s use that empowering to spread joy and love copiously into the world around us. There’s still a world in great need of change out there, so pop the bubble and maintain consciousness.</p>

          <h2><a href="/who-is-my-neighbor/">who is my neighbor?</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>A valid question that I’ve asked many times before this past Sunday. Little did I know a question seemingly so safe would be blown out of the water. However, in my quest to change the world, (yep, I’m still holding onto that idea) it’s critical to my mission. All it took was a bullet point in a sermon to explain this simple misconception I had about Luke 10. Here’s how it’ll help change the world.</p>

<p><strong>The question has context.</strong> This may seem plain, but we need to remember that the Bible, as with every piece of literature has a social context. This question here is no different. The question is asked of Jesus by a lawyer seeking self-justification. The answer, he believes, will prove that he is upholding the moral code to the nth degree. He is trying to show that his obedience to the law was on par with that of the Pharisees and Sadducees, or the religious elites of the day. However, in the attempt, what we see is a man trying to get by on doing the least possible. He is hoping that Jesus will answer his question plainly so that he and generations to come would know exactly only to whom we need to be nice. Unfortunately for him and us, we get no such simplicity. Instead, there is a parable waiting on the other end.</p>

<p><strong>A Samaritan’s deed.</strong> Sorry to you Biblical scholars out there, but what’s significant about the story itself is the fact that a Samaritan (worse than a Gentile because of their half-Jew-half-Gentile lineage) helped out a Jew. Jews hated the Samaritans because they represented the watering down of God’s people. They represented everything evil about the times of captivity, harkened to a time darker than many Jews cared to imagine or remember. The Samaritans were essentially the bastards of society in those days.</p>

<p><strong>A response.</strong> The crux of this story isn’t the Jew, the passersby or the Samaritan. It isn’t the guys who mug the Jew. The tipping point, what I’ve missed all along is the question that follows the story. What starts as “And who is my neighbor?” is transformed into “Which of these three, do you think, proved to be a neighbor to the man who fell among the robbers?” In that rewording, you see heart change. You see a world of difference. No longer is it a question of who we can ignore, but rather if we’re being a neighbor ourselves. The focus has been turned round till it’s a ray of sunshine on the dark spots of our heart. This difference of perspective moves away from the minimum and pushes us toward excellence. This is world change.</p>

<p>Simply, the world cannot change without lives being transformed. And this, this is what the Parable of the Good Samaritan is about; this world changing transformation is what the Bible is about. The Bible and what I’m striving after this year are not a list of rules or restrictions. What they are are a new framework to view this life. They are the opportunity of a lifetime to pull ourselves and the worlds around us up by the bootstraps and build a brighter today and future. They are the hope for which we’ve been longing forever. It is the cry of our hearts. The coincidence is, it’s been right in front of our faces all this time. So I ask you, which of you, though maybe you consider yourself a modern Samaritan, will prove to be a neighbor this day?</p>

          <h2><a href="/new-years-resolution/">new year’s resolution</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>I like to tell people that I don’t make New Year’s resolutions and I haven’t in several years. Why? I just give up on them, like many others. I got tired of failing and instead of figuring out how to live up to another rule, I just stopped making them. This year was supposed to be no different, but I failed in that attempt. I had one hit me the other week like a freight train. I call it a freight train, because it is both massive and simple. It’s weighty, yet attainable. I invite you to join me this year, because I know you can do it as well and it’s this: change the world.</p>

<p><strong>Our world is in need of change.</strong> I think we can all agree that this world could use some drastic improvement as we see poverty, hunger, killing plastered across the news everyday. However, we don’t need to change the globe simultaneously to have affected the world. Actually, the world is a collection of locales. It is a summation of microcosms and that is within our grasps. It is our own small worlds (however big or small they may actually be) that need us the most. That, in turn, will leave the world a different place. Especially if those affected for the better repeat the effects in their own worlds. You see what I’m getting at here?</p>

<p><strong>Even raindrops wear away granite.</strong> Change is most lasting when enacted through relationships. But, it’s imperative for us, like Jesus (whether you look at Him as God, prophet or teacher, alike), to focus on one relationship at a time. And within that relationship, be intentional and present in every interaction, every conversation. <em>That</em>, my friend, is our raindrop. And you’ll find that most people aren’t as tough as granite. In fact, most people are very soft, however it’s the crusty exterior we must gently break through. It’s the insulation against a world grown cold that we must patiently wait for the raindrops to erode. It’s not just a matter of time, but of a growing trust that our intentions are not to leave them broken, exposed.</p>

<p><strong>We don’t need a platform.</strong> I don’t know about you, but I feel I need a platform, a set of principles that people respect me for, to be able to enact change. That credibility comes through one thing. If I, if <em>we</em> wait, we’ll never start. That “platform” is built through interactions and relationships. It’s built through purposefully with the muck of life (whether yours or theirs) with loved ones. Don’t have anyone close enough? Relationships have to start somewhere. Why not dive right in? What have you to lose?</p>

<p>Who’s to say that what starts out a New Year’s resolution can’t become a lifetime? Again, we have to start <em>somewhere</em>. And if we have nothing to guide us, then where can we derive purpose? Call it an experiment, call it a stunt, call it what you will, I think I’m on to something here and I’m going to see this through. You have a choice today, like we all do every day; what will you stand for? What will today be lived for? Remember, with anything worthwhile, there will be highs and lows, joys and trials. It’s up to us to commit and, in time, if we are faithful we will see the benefits. So, the ball’s in your court, friend.</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p>Standing up in front of a crowd, gathered to witness your brother’s wedding is undoubtedly a different experience. Being in the bridal party in this scenario is a truly unique and honored experience. Both of these realities of this past weekend got me to thinking about the experiences I’ve shared with my own friends and loved ones and how important they all are.</p>

<p><strong>A life less lived.</strong> That’s life without these people. The triumphs particularly of this past year have all been with the direct help of those who care about me. I cannot claim any greatness of my own, because on my own, I’ve only faltered.</p>

<p><strong>Enriched.</strong> My favorite memories of this year have all been shared with family and friends. They have been there, making good times and bad, great. Each brings a unique vantage point. Each gives insight that I on my own would have merely lacked.</p>

<p>Life, as evidenced this past year, is not the memories and it is not the trinkets we collect along the way. It is the growth we experience along the way and the lives we take along for the ride. Friends and family have been the greatest gifts from God I’ve ever received. And it took my brother’s wedding and seeing everyone who loves him to realize how blessed I am and how much I’ve needed and will continue to need those people each and every day moving forward.</p>

<p>To my faithful readers, I count you as friends. Thank you. Each one of you are important to me as well. And it’s for you I continue to try to make this blog better and better. Because you give me much each week in your readership. Again, thank you and happy New Year.</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p>These are the words of a guest who’s staying with my family in anticipation of my brother’s wedding. As the kitchen silenced last night, he began a speech and in that speech, he spoke profoundly, “I figured out that business is love…Everything is love.” And the simplicity in summing up life in that very moment nearly brought me to tears.</p>

<p><strong>Everything is love.</strong> This man had boiled down the Christian message, really in three words. And we as Christians know this message. We know that God is love, Jesus came down to love man perfectly. The Bible is chock full of examples of God’s love for us. Yes, we get this, but rarely do we rehearse it and refresh it in our minds.</p>

<p><strong>Our head knowledge isn’t the problem.</strong> We know the message, but we’ve forgotten (maybe we never knew) how to apply it. It’s simple. <em>Everything</em> is love. Even in the way we go about standing in line for our morning coffees. Even the way we sit on the train/bus on the way to work. The motivations for saying the things we do are most certainly included here. Let me reiterate: not a single breath is to be taken without a purpose to use it for a loving cause.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So now faith, hope, and love abide, these three; but the greatest of these is love. — I Corinthians 13:13</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There’s no need to complicate this message. That complication is of our own devise. What holds us back, what tears others down is fear. Where love is everything, there is no room for fear. And without fear, there can be no hate. Love is everything. And let everything we do today forth be in love.</p>

          <h2><a href="/prayer-will-save-christmas/">prayer will save christmas</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>Merry Christmas Eve to most of you! Admittedly, friends, yesterday morning was a tough one for me. Staring up the face of a week long cliff of non-stop family and entertaining, culminating in my brother’s wedding, was a bit daunting to take in all at once for me. I love people and I love my family, but the prospect of two family parties in two nights and knowing that getting home from the second would signal the beginning of entertaining a family of strangers for a week was a lot to take in. Then, on the other end of this whirlwind is a wedding in which I have to play the brother of the groom (oh, darn). In light of all this, I wasn’t too keen on last night, today or Christmas. In fact, I wanted little to do with any of the three. but this is where I’ve seen an answer to prayer.</p>

<p><strong>Family, community.</strong> I find myself talking a lot about these two elements of life. I find them both critical in a season such as this, wrought with the consumerism that has so evidently set in. Yet, despite my own emphasis, it seemed impossible to muster that focus in my real life. It was rather discouraging. This is the nature of life, being attacked where it hurts you most. What defines each of us, what separates is how we react. However, in a life submitted to God, only the weak fight.</p>

<p><strong>God is sovereign.</strong> There are no qualifications. There are no interjections or anything but the definitive. God <em>is</em> sovereign. That means that in our joy, as well as our struggle, He is. Through chaos and calm, pain and bliss, God is no less sovereign. This is why the strong give in. Because their strength is derived in the amount of trust they place in the familiar unknown. It is only the strong who know and are certain that to fight is a waste of strength. And so, it was in that moment of fear and weakness, I turned to my strength and prayed. Yes, I was stifling the tears of a bewildered and overwhelmed son. But, I emerged differently from that prayer than I entered.</p>

<p><strong>Prayer will save Christmas.</strong> Maybe you find yourself where I was yesterday morning, defeated, overwhelmed, helpless. You don’t have to stay there. You are far from trapped. When I finished praying for a changed heart, for joy and a true Spirit of the season, I felt it. I knew immediately there was a change within me. And I could see the change in my body language. Where have you fallen, friend, that praying to the Sovereign can’t fix? Where have you hidden that the God who <em>is</em> cannot find you? What defeat have you suffered that Christmas cannot be saved through prayer?</p>

<p>This idea of prayer is not foreign. It’s been practiced for thousands upon thousands of years. Maybe it’s about time I give some real credence to it. Care to join me, friend? I wish you would. We are not praying to a deity removed from creation, hoping blindly they will act favorably toward our appeals. No, we are praying to the God of <em>all</em>, <em>the</em> Sovereign. The God who can create with His voice can most certainly rescue from another lackluster Christmas. All we need to do is ask, earnestly, and we will receive (James 1:5–6). So, let’s all go make this the best Christmas we can. What do we have to lose?</p>

            <p>…And I feel fine…Yes, you’re welcome for that. So, to all you Mayan calendar subscribers, I offer my condolences as your subscription ends tomorrow. To the rest of us, the world isn’t going to end tomorrow, at least there is no more certainty in it ending tomorrow than this very instant. And with that thought, I realize I take every new day for granted, every next breath as given. While I am aware that I may very well only have till the end (or some fraction) of tomorrow, there is nothing special in that thought. However, what am I doing about it?</p>

<p><strong>End times.</strong> Let’s just say that for the sake of argument, the world’s going to end tomorrow. Would not now be the perfect time to reassess my life? Wouldn’t now be the time to make my life one that I’d be proud of knocking on the pearly gates? Wouldn’t now be an opportune moment to really embrace the holiday spirit and spread joy around me wherever I go? Really, what time, what face have I to lose?</p>

<p><strong>Today is no different.</strong> That’s right. Today is no different from yesterday or the day before or any day before that. We are not guaranteed anything in this life. Our time here is constantly counting down. The sand in the glass has always been diminishing. Yet, we grow more complacent day by day. Our time here is not significantly diminished by the dawning of tomorrow’s sun as compared to today’s. Every action, every thought could be our last. Yet, we do nothing about this fact. Have we become so calloused?</p>

<p><strong>The ending of an age.</strong> This is what the Mayans were referring to by the end of their calendar. You know what, I’d be OK with proving them right. Let’s make this the end of an age of a malcontent youth hopelessly looking onto the world swirling around them. Let us usher in a world that cares about one another, from the greatest (as we see them) to the least. Let us not take for granted another breath, another meal, another interaction. Instead, let us take every breath captive and use it purposefully for beautifying the world around us. No thought, no action is too small. Come on, friend, it has to start somewhere. Why not now?</p>

<p>Sure, the world may end tomorrow, but how do you know it won’t end right now? I certainly don’t and it’s about time I started acting accordingly. There isn’t enough time in this life to waste, whether we have twenty-four hours or twenty-four years (or more). Starting with this Christmas season, I’m going to cherish the loved ones around me in the way that I always should have been. I’m going to love my coworkers, servers and everyone else with whom I come into contact. Because, whether we’re proving the Mayans right or not, this world needs change. And that change needs to start somewhere. Friend, will it start with you?</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p>“When were you happiest?” the question rang out through the tranquility of the evening. It had just enough of a barb on it to prick me and keep my mind churning on it the rest of the weekend. It was in the middle of a sermon Sunday morning about finding peace in the wake of the events at Newtown, Connecticut that I understood what brought me to the time when I was happiest. Only through reliving a bit of the chaos and the tragedy did I find my own peace. Walk with me and see how grief gives way to joy.</p>

<p>My world had come crashing down on a bitter December evening a few years ago. My girlfriend of nearly two-and-a-half years dumped me and all the hurt and insecurity I’d buried from my parents’ separation had been ripped from beneath the surface like a geyser. I struggled mightily the next two months, sinking into a deep depression, going to a dark place in my life. Then, one day I broke. I knew I lacked the strength to go on any further, so I crashed face first on my bed and wept bitterly. Through the deluge of tears and the gasping, I stammered out something along the lines of “I give up,” and I truly did that afternoon. In that very moment, I understood the breakup and I had peace about it. The next day, began the two months or so that I was genuinely joyful and I’ve never spent more time reading my Bible (and enjoying it) or praying before or since. My friend, that is the heart’s content.</p>

<p>Once again, the world came crashing down on Friday. Several lives ended. Senselessly. A season meant for friends, family and loved ones, pristine, <em>shattered</em> forever. I do not know this pain. It must be the greatest torment a parent can endure. Maybe even the greatest trial a human can endure. The fact is, many lives in those few moments were broken. And truly, my heart breaks for each one. But, this is not the end. However, for the story to progress, we have to turn back.</p>

<p><strong>The Christmas story.</strong> God’s Son came to earth as a baby. He endured all the growing pains we have. He had friends, enemies, family. He experienced every emotion we do and saw about all there was to see in this world. He had been to every high and every low because there was no other way to God. That was exactly how it had to be. Jesus had to become powerless. Why? Because only through this process could we have someone to lift us up from where we are and bring us up to the heavenly highs. Because in these times, we need someone who can pick us up off the floor and piece back together our hearts in the way only God can. When the hurt overwhelms and we no longer see the light, we need a God who’s been to the deepest depths to come and lead us out from there. Because we need Him <strong>now</strong>.</p>

<p>I’m not going to lie through my teeth, telling you acts like this make sense in God’s plan. I’m not going to feed you the empty calories of this being God’s will and we need to be content and joyful through all trials. No, I will mourn with those in Newtown and around the world. I will feel the grief and ask God why? But, I will mourn and question, knowing that I have a capable Savior able to understand because He felt this grief. I have a powerful Savior able to pick up my broken heart, because He cares about the heart more than all. I may not understand, but I want to turn nowhere else right now. In time, hearts will heal. In time, we will begin to understand and it will no longer be senseless. It will not be happy, but we’ll understand how God is sovereign even still. In the meantime, I trust He is healing hearts, just as He only knows how.</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p>The idea of baby Jesus doesn’t sit well with our culture. Much less does the grownup on the cross supposedly providing a sacrifice for the sin for which we cannot atone. I believe the deity of Jesus is the single greatest stumbling block to following Christianity. Yet, we are barreling down on the day we’ve designated to celebrate His birth. Tragically, it makes sense that we latched on to the bringing of gifts and have conveniently forgotten the rest of the story. We focus on a minor detail and miss the plot. Gifts, very valuable ones, were brought, yes, but because they were designated for the baby Messiah. However, the more important fact is that God had sent Himself down onto this earth to save a people in desperate need of saving, because He cared <em>that</em> much.</p>

<p><strong>What was the best gift you ever received?</strong> What comes to mind for me are the simple gifts people gave me like teaching me how to drive a manual transmission car, intentionally spending time with me, giving themselves to show they love me. I’ve received much throughout my life, more than a significant many, but none of the physical presents are memorable today. On the first Christmas, we try to get the story backwards. The real gift was God giving Himself to the world as a baby. It was a humble box, the swaddling cloth and manger in a barn. It was inauspicious, boring even, but God is rarely about being flashy. No, the best gift was God literally giving us Himself in the form of a baby, Jesus.</p>

<p><strong>Was Jesus really God?</strong> I’m not going into apologetics to get you to believe. Honestly, many of the miracles performed were being performed over the known world during this time. Jesus was not the only show in town. There were plenty of people claiming to be the Messiah and there are still even today. There are many people who were executed on the crucifix, even people who came back from the dead. What serves to differentiate the historical Jesus from other messiahs and magicians is that Jesus didn’t die twice. He was the only man to die, resurrect, but never die again. Instead, He ascended up into the clouds. I’m not telling you, skeptical friend, that He was absolutely God, but maybe. Just maybe He was.</p>

<p><strong>Jesus’ morals.</strong> I think we can all agree with the example set forth by Jesus. So, let’s emulate Him this holiday season. Rather than throwing worthless possessions at people, Jesus sat down with society’s rejects and His loved ones alike and invested in their lives. He gave His time, His heart, and let everyone know they were valuable, loved and deeply. He didn’t need gifts. He gave Himself. And <em>all</em> of Him.</p>

          <h2><a href="/faith-is-willing-to-struggle/">faith is willing to struggle</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p><strong>We don’t struggle alone.</strong> It’s hard to imagine a faith without question. In my case, it’s impossible. While I’m quite familiar with, “Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen,” I don’t believe this is the only faith (Hebrews 11:1). Instead, I believe it to be the faith to which we ascribe. Along the way, we will stumble, fumble and doubt. However, our response should not be to self-flagellate into faithful submission, but rather to pray for heart change in the full knowledge we are in good company.</p>

<p><strong>Faith noticed.</strong> On more than one occasion, I’ve had people tell me they respected me for my faith. They didn’t necessarily agree with it, but they respected it. While those are some great compliments, they come with an admission: I struggle with my faith, often. I wrestle with questions particularly of application in a day and age so filled with grey. Oftentimes, I’m led to discouragement. I realize that it is in these times I need most to be reminded of the people exemplified in God’s Word. The “heroes” of the faith were all flawed. Deeply. They committed every sin imaginable, yet, God looks upon them favorably. Suddenly, I am not so weak anymore.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/devotionals/morning-and-evening/2012/12/10">Spurgeon’s Evening Meditation for December 10</a></p>

<p><strong>Only one can change the heart.</strong> Accidentally, I read a day ahead in Spurgeon’s Morning and Evening. However, it reminded me that in my moments of apparent weakness (of which they are), it is not my job, nor is it my ability to wring faith from my fragile heart. Heart change belongs to the heart Creator. Heart change comes in the timing of Him as well. A moment sooner is merely too soon for my best. A moment later is also short of my best. Struggle for the soul is like exercise for the muscles. Without some tearing, sweat and pain, there can be no growth. The weaker fat is burned off, so more muscle may grow in its stead. With a little pain, comes great strength.</p>

<p>And so, friend, I leave you with this today. What questions do you have for God? What doubts linger in your mind? There’s no shame in bringing them to the table. You are no less a child of God for the asking. Your doubt is not the lens through which your Father sees you. He welcomes you as any father should. Is it not the delight of the Father to share His love with His children? Is it not His joy to reveal truth to children begging Him for it? Then, why do we withhold the struggle within? Let’s begin to tear down that emotional wall today. Let’s struggle. Together.</p>

          <h2><a href="/an-end-to-christmas-consumerism/">an end to christmas consumerism</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>When did it begin? I don’t know. However, some years later, I found myself staring at a computer screen agonizing over my Christmas list. Literally, I spent hours on it. I went to deal site after deal site to figure out what I might want and where I might recommend my family look to find the requested gifts. And then I paused. As I fought back the tears, I navigated to the page I knew would end my dreaded list. “Honestly, I’d be happiest if you just skipped all this meaningless crap and put the money toward a donation in my name toward one of the following charities…” I’d had enough of the season brought forth by the ever-lengthening Black Friday.</p>

<p><strong>Another corporate catastrophe.</strong> I avoid Black Friday shopping like the plague. I don’t avoid it because of the manic crowds, but rather because of everything that the day has come to represent. See, like any relationship, this holiday season is characterized by how it begins. And I think we’d be hard pressed to argue with any conviction that Black Friday is anything more than ruthless consumerism. I don’t doubt that much of it is well intentioned (having seen it in action), however, the goal is merely to get the best gifts for the cheapest prices. All meaning, all of the true purpose of the season is nigh forgotten in the caffeine-induced shopping fury of the…however long it now is.</p>

<p><strong>’Tis the season.</strong> Unfortunately, the next four weeks or so follow in the footsteps of this chaotic day. It makes the days of advent, those that ought to be cherished, enjoying friend and family, grueling. And so, I finished my list in the way that I did. I don’t want a Christmas filled with gifts that I’ll enjoy for a few weeks. It’s not worth the headache for my family. It’s not worth the stress and the frustration of traffic and lines. My petty wants are as far from the meaning of Christmas as could be. But, for us, that’s considered normal. For those of you who know me, normal doesn’t sit well with me.</p>

<p><strong>Radically traditional.</strong> Christmas is about giving. It was never about receiving. This is why God sent down to earth a baby and not a man. It’s about cherishing what is good and pure. It’s about celebrating togetherness and love. And so, why not ask for a gift that, in receiving, allows you to be giving simultaneously? Why not forgo what is almost sure to lose its luster in a blinking of the eye and give what cannot be taken away? Why not choose to show love for others instead of keeping it for our ever-fortunate selves? But, then again, I’m not normal.</p>

<p>I don’t mean to come off as Scrooge here. I will not hand my dismayed family certificates of donation in their names to charities which they did not specify. I won’t force my will on them, but because that’s not what this season is about. I will however be thoughtful in my giving. The things I give, I promise will be in nothing but love and as helpful to those less fortunate as possible. I urge you to do the same. But, this Christmas I want to be nothing more than as traditional as is possible. I care about three things: family, love and giving. If I cannot muster one (and I will have plenty of opportunity for each), then it is only a fault of my own making. This season, let’s bring back what truly matters. Let’s give and love as if there will never be another Christmas. You can’t guarantee there will be.</p>

          <h2><a href="/the-kingdom-of-the-blind/">the kingdom of the blind</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p><strong>A blind view of heaven.</strong> I was minding my own business, singing worship in church yesterday when it happened. In the only row in front of my mom and me sat a mother and her blind son. No more than seven, he touched my heart and I had to stifle tears through the next twenty-some minutes of singing. It wasn’t so much the fact that he was blind as it was the thought that how beautiful would heaven look to this boy when he got there.</p>

<p><strong>Not by sight.</strong> If you’ve spent any time in a church at all, you’ll know that faith is the crux of spirituality. And that faith is not built on experience or sight alone. Yet, us consistent churchgoers continue to propagate the cliche that the awakening of our faith is the opening of our eyes. I have to admit, this makes sense on the surface, but once you get past that thin layer, does it hold? Maybe it does for you, but I have to push back on this one.</p>

<p><strong>Untainted view.</strong> For all the beauty that God has given us in this world, it is by nature imperfect, tarnished. If it is only tarnished in its impermeability, it is still at its core imperfect. I can’t help but imagine that this blind boy’s vision of heaven isn’t tainted by such imperfection. Sure, I believe he’ll be blown away when he gets there, but only because his imagination is limited by his humanity. Unlike the seeing majority, he won’t have the broken examples of his earthly experience to stand in the way of his perception of God’s heavenly kingdom. I’d argue that his view of heaven is far purer than mine will ever be.</p>

<p><strong>Losing sight.</strong> Maybe gaining clarity on God and heaven isn’t sight at all. What if instead, it’s becoming more comfortable with closing our eyes? What if faith is the growing comfort with not being able to rely on our senses (see Descartes’ Meditations)? What if our senses, particularly our sight with which we take in about 80% of the world, are merely to aid us in our spiritual youth? Is deafness or blindness so much an impairment?</p>

<p>So, friend, I turn to you. Do we rely too much on senses, on feeling and experience or am I missing the mark? Are we so attached to the blessing that we cannot depart with the senses that perceive them or do we need those senses? Is sight a crucial component to faith? Is it possibly the training wheels to faith? Or could sight actually be detrimental to our faith? I implore you, please tell me what you think. Is God’s the <em>Kingdom of the blind</em>?</p>

          <h2><a href="/freedom-is-crazy/">freedom is crazy</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p><strong>Everyone of us is a slave in some way to some thing.</strong> Many of us in this country are slaves to our jobs, to promotion and success at work. Many of us are slaves to happiness. If you’re ready to stop reading, I’m sorry for upsetting you and that is my slavery to comfort coming out. Huh? Yes, you can be a slave to just about anything including your cat should you so wish. You’re thinking right about now either I’m crazy (which I won’t argue against) or I’m plain wrong (and I may be). But take a look at your priorities and try to find a trend in them. Mine reflect a desire for status quo and steadying rather than rocking the proverbial boat.</p>

<p><strong>Merciless.</strong> My headstrong desire for comfort has been killing me all my life. Comfort, like all the aforementioned masters, doesn’t give breaks. It doesn’t allow for joy or triumph. It is only a wearying cycle of putting one hand above the other in an ascent of a neverending rope. It’s monotonous and it’s boring, but it’s predictable and safe. You know what those two words translate to? Boring and pansy. I’ll be buying my tract at the cemetary later this week. Hopefully, that’ll be enough time, assuming the boredom or the manic pursuit doesn’t kill me first.</p>

<p><strong>Crazy.</strong> Freedom is a word we throw around an awful lot in this country. According to us and the rest of the world, we’re free. I’d disagree, pointing to tribes in sub-Saharan Africa and tell you we’re far from free. Why? We are so used to being free that we’ve shackled ourselves to the freedom we claim. We chain ourselves to success, wealth, power, influence (to name a few). We stake our lives on these pursuits, dying miserable, feeling like we’ve reached the top of the mountain empty. We were spent long ago, but we were too busy pleasing our masters (who may be ourselves) to stop and realize it. Our pursuits are emptying us of what makes us human each day, but we’re too busy to even care.</p>

<p><strong>Different.</strong> Now, if what we’re doing already is crazy, the idea that we could be free under the authority of another is well beyond that. It goes contrary to everything within my bones, yet at the same time, it’s the cry of my heart. I want to be freed from the incessant trivialities of this life. I want freedom from all the details, the minutiae, the rat race. I was made for more than to be bogged down in the details, but there is only one way to accomplish this. Only one master can free me from all that gets me down in the day to day and that is Jesus. Yep, I just went Sunday School on y’all. Here’s the thing: for once, it’s not the cop-out, but rather the <em>whole</em> answer. Freedom comes in laying down our ever-growing collection of rocks and allowing Jesus to pick them up and lead the way. We are free to follow, free to question, free to doubt and explore. At the same time, we are at last free to serve something other than ourselves. Now <em>that</em> is freedom. Tell me it’s not crazy.</p>

<p>For freedom to be true freedom, it must be crazy. It must go against the status quo. It has to be countercultural. Otherwise, there is no reason to call it anything but normal. Freedom is anything <em>but</em> normal. And that is precisely what we are made to be; <em>anything but normal</em>. While on the surface we may seem normal, have regular jobs, live in a run-of-the-mill house and have a mildly dysfunctional family, in truth, that is where the similarity stops. We were made for more. We were made to serve God, the only master big enough for a heart made for heaven. I’m OK with that not making complete sense. Are you?</p>

          <h2><a href="/god-speaks-through-sin/">god speaks through sin</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p><strong>God speaks through sin.</strong> Inevitably, we avoid conseuquences. I do it quite often. We do something and realize the backlash is going to hurt, so we cringe and think of ways to escape the pain. I have my hearing this morning for the DUI which I’d mentioned a couple months back. What I was most scared of yesterday wasn’t so much the legal ramifications, but the way I would be viewed by the people at my church. This came to a head yesterday when I was trying to meet up with a pastor to talk about some questions I had about doctrine and had to explain that I wasn’t sure when I could meet on a morning and then why I couldn’t meet. His answer was probably more impactful than the hour and a half that followed.</p>

<p><strong>Sin is a misperception of God.</strong> Those weren’t his exact words, but you get the gist. When we choose to act accordingly to our wills rather than God’s, it’s merely because there is something we don’t understand about God. I steal because we don’t believe Him to provide for our every need. I lie because I’m not secure in my belief that God is sovereign and good in His sovereignty. I break God’s heart because I don’t know it.</p>

<p><strong>If you don’t know God, how can you know yourself or others?</strong> My misperception has been to look at self and then focus on God. If I don’t know my Creator, my Originator, then how can I know the original purpose for me? How can I know for what I was made? How can I understand purpose, it’s nature, let alone my own? Much less can I understand others. If we seek first to understand the Heart of life, then maybe will we begin to understand our own. Why God? Because in the beginning and the end, it was never about me.</p>

<p><strong>Share the truth.</strong> What good is truth kept hidden under a basket? What good is wisdom locked away in a safe? Truth, wisdom only benefits us when they are shared. Otherwise, they are merely wasted. To keep them locked away is to say once again, it is about <em>me</em> and we’ve established it already was. And, no, to share truth costs us nothing and we do not run out of that truth. Truth is not a competitive advantage. It is an unmerited gift, so share it as such.</p>

<p>We avoid consequence and often. I think it’s because on some level we know we are accountable to a higher power. We know we’re accountable to God, if you will. However, this fear of the unknown gets compounded by the fact that we are avoiding the consequence of an action we perceive to be bad, which was spawned by an already flawed image of the divine. Therefore, not only do we expect cosmic judgment, but we expect it in some way to be less benevolent than is true. And so we run. But we don’t have to run. In fact, it’s in those moments that God’s calling us loudest back to Himself. It’s in those moments He puts Himself most clearly on display for us to finally begin to understand. He wants to reveal the universe to us, but He knows (often I don’t) that first we must understand the Heart of it all. We must understand God rightly. Then, we need to share that revelation with others. And that’s how <em>God speaks through sin</em>.</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p><strong>Thank full.</strong> The day of Thanksgiving is upon us and I have to admit, it’s snuck up on me. I resisted the urge to write a holiday themed post this morning, but over the past day or so I’ve been reminded that I have much to be thankful for and rarely am I voicing my appreciation. This is not an exhaustive list, nor is it a “top (insert number)” list. It’s merely a list of the things at the forefront of my mind.</p>

<p><strong>In your face.</strong> This is the only way my family knows how to operate. We are either smothering one another or staging some new Cold War (happens rarely). But I’m deeply grateful for this. It sounds obtrusive and cumbersome, but it’s not at all. My family, my mom, dad, sister and brother, are always staying in contact with me, trying to get every bit of detail of my life, figuring out how things are really going and I love it. It shows me that they care and care enough to roll up their sleeves and live life with me, <em>all</em> of it. And I don’t make it easy.</p>

<p><strong>Fruitful labor.</strong> One, I have a job. I never thought that’d be a big deal, but there are many who don’t and I realize that I’m fortunate for that fact alone. Two, I have a job working with fun and interesting people, doing something that is also stimulating. I think this aspect is both rarer and more overlooked. The people alone make my job. My manager, my coworkers have me looking forward to getting to work most days (it wouldn’t be work if I were excited everyday) just to see what will be said or done that day.</p>

<p><strong>Let freedom ring.</strong> Say what you want about our government, but even today they are working hard (despite how it may seem) to keep us free and safe. I believe I take this for granted every day I open my Bible without a second thought and read and contemplate my faith. On the other side of the freedom coin, I’m grateful for God. I’m feeling particularly blessed to have a God who welcomes my questions and doubts and greets me with open arms, abundant grace. I have a God who has freed me to struggle with my faith, not trapped me so that I must struggle to be free. I’m very unlovable sometimes, but He reminds me often that He hasn’t and won’t give up on me.</p>

<p>There are so many more things I can add, but it would quickly become a laundry list. Plus, there’s family to go see. If you’re not there already or if you can’t see your family, please go see some friends and soon. Barge in. Make the awkward phone call. Just go and watch football if there’s not enough food. The main point is find some people, some person, and spend some time with them. Let them know in the midst of the chit chat you’re grateful for them. Then, when you go home, rinse and repeat the next day and the next. You’ll find you’re one step closer to thank <em>full</em>.</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p><strong>One day workweek.</strong> I really love the fact that I can walk to church each week. Yesterday was one of the few times I was early enough to take advantage of this privilege. As I walked up the street, iPod in tow, I realized why that walk was so particularly enjoyable. I realized why I felt like I needed that walk before getting to my preferred place of worship. It’s because that walk represented a brief respite from the other 6 days of chaos and mayhem that my life is. That walk was the first break I’d taken from the rat race that my life so easily slips back into.</p>

<p><strong>A life without solitude.</strong> Even when I’m taking it easy, I can’t seem to take even the least bit of time and spend some quality time alone with my Maker. It seems that in those down times, I’m too spent to begin to take stock of my heart and I can’t possibly be bothered to work on anything in my life that may have come up in the past week. The promise of telling myself all is well is too tempting in the moment and so I scurry off, busying myself with a new tv show, a movie or some other mindless entertainment.</p>

<p><strong>Sleepless nights.</strong> Inevitably, this is where the ignoring leads you. The thoughts that have been pushed back down eventually make their way to the front of the mind again, but at the least opportune time. Nights become shorter as I’ve found myself more often than not tossing and turning. Days blur into one another and fatigue, a mind, body and soul sort, sets in. But “I’m fine, I’m fine,” I continue to reassure myself. At some point in the cycle, I know, however, that I am anything <em>but</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Awkward silence.</strong> It’s at that recognition that I quickly turn to God, but while I may be glad that I spent some time with Him, I am very aware that the time felt unfulfilling. They’re awkward, clunky and filled with the garbage I’ve been carrying around for the past however long it had been. However, this time, by definition of relationship as I’m told and have come to believe this spiritual life is to be, cannot be fulfilling. What the time lacks is listening. The time lacks humility, as my needs and wants are still front and center in my mind. The time is spent me focusing on fixing only myself, not the relationship I’ve ignored. And my soul knows this.</p>

<p><strong>Always on the go.</strong> There are so many opportunities out there that I have trouble focusing. There’s always a new one shining bright with possibility in my eyes and so I foolishly run after it. Always left behind is the relationship with God that has become tattered and worn. It’s lost it’s luster of novelty and so I am quick to throw it aside each and every day. Sure, I may write a post one day and I may have brief quiet time the next morning, but by and large, my days are bereft of any sign that I live in grace and love. I am a Christian in name only.</p>

<p>If you think this post is about me, friend, you’re not looking far enough. This post is meant to show you that we all have similar struggles whether we are Christian, Muslim, deist or atheist. Our priorities will always be something we’ll be reevaluating. However, accepting Jesus as your Savior doesn’t fix that problem. It doesn’t make you that much closer to perfection, but it’s certainly helped me to find the next step along that path. Don’t worry, I’m pretty far away at this point, don’t let anyone else, spiritual or not, tell you differently. Yet, if we do call ourselves Christian or seeking God, shouldn’t we be actively spending time in that pursuit? Shouldn’t we be scheduling time working toward that end? We shouldn’t suffice for a <em>one day workweek</em>.</p>

          <h2><a href="/not-a-birthright/">not a birthright</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p><strong>Not a birthright.</strong> I came to a startling conclusion this week and I feel it’s necessary I share it with you, the reader. I share because you, my friend, have taken the time to navigate to my corner of an internet filled with noise. I share because it’s too important to keep to myself. It seems that America has gotten something starkly wrong over the past few decades and it’s about time we set the record straight. <strong>We, America, are not God’s chosen people.</strong></p>

<p><strong>History of the chosen.</strong> The Israelites became God’s people for a specific reason. Religion was a relatively new thing in the world when Abram was a young lad. However, most religion centered around a multiplicity of gods. God decided to use a man and his clan to build up a minuscule nation amongst the greatest concentration of civilizations at that time. He chose the Israelites so that He might better reveal Himself to the world on a greater scale as the true God on a stage filled with hundreds, maybe even thousands of gods. He used the story of the nation of Israel to tell His own.</p>

<p><strong>Times have changed.</strong> God’s told His story. In fact, throughout the Old Testament, you see glimpses of God trying to convince the Jews to be less exclusive and foreshadow the acceptance of the Gentiles, the heathens of the day. You see, even the chosen people weren’t the <em>only</em> people of God. After the life, death and resurrection of Jesus,the work was finished and everyone could be God’s chosen people. Yet, somehow, two thousand years later that trend has reversed and America is the only chosen people. Sorry, I missed that part of the Bible.</p>

<p><strong>A dangerous cocktail.</strong> America has taken up a very weighty mantle in the world as its protector and caretaker. I’m proud of this fact that we live in a nation that cares enough and is powerful enough to do this, but this has been taken a step too far. We’ve contaminated this honor by framing it in a religious context. There was no angel from God who came down to deliver the decree that God blessed America and nowhere else. There is nothing in the Bible that even advocates mixing nationalism and religion. In fact, God from the beginning warned the Israelites against such things. He knew what we should’ve figured out by now.</p>

<p><strong>With pride comes the fall.</strong> The worst atrocities the world has seen have been committed in the name of god. I cannot bring myself to capitalize that ‘g’ because it is not for God these acts have been committed. Even now, this nation marginalizes illegal immigrants, uses excessive military force and exercises both racism and sexism. Though we don’t throw around the phrase as much anymore, I think we all know under whose authority we’re claiming our actions. It’s sick and perverted. Yet, we’re the only ones who can’t see it as such.</p>

<p>Too often have I heard the phrase “God’s removing His hands from this nation,” and I have to ask myself, “If God’s infinite, where would His hands go?” Sarcasm aside, God is not removing Himself from anywhere as He saved somewhere so wicked that Jonah refused to go there. However, God never needed this nation to do His bidding for Him. He’s quite capable as was evidenced by the number of Christians throughout the centuries before the settling of America. He doesn’t need us, but we certainly need Him. And He can definitely use us if we’re willing and cooperative (or not, again citing Jonah). Being God’s chosen is a privilege, not a birthright. It’s time we start living a life up to spec with what we claim.</p>

          <h2><a href="/the-devil-within/">the devil within</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>The devil within. Maybe this isn’t central to our theologies, but it’s something I’ve been thinking about for some time and I wanted to kick the tires with y’all. What if the devil isn’t who we think he is? What if he’s not real at all, but every bit as real as we believe him to be at the same time? To boil it down, what if the devil is just each one of us?</p>

<p><strong>Devil’s in the details.</strong> I know the Bible says that Lucifer led an angel rebellion in heaven, but if heaven is as I’ve been led to believe, how could anyone care to leave that place? Why would anyone want better than paradise? How could anyone want more than fulfillment of the soul?</p>

<p><strong>A dark reality.</strong> I believe we are all made in God’s image, but I also believe that the other contingency of our being is made up of the less than heavenly. This journey we’re on is meant to teach us what specifically is less than good and help us deal with it all and rectify some. The journey is meant to bring us closer to the heavenly realm, but only by the realization that we are far away from it and we need help reaching farther upward. We all know we’re flawed, but maybe we’re flawed to the point that we are each our own satan.</p>

<p><strong>The cold awakening.</strong> Yes, I just called you the devil. However, I also called myself and everyone the devil as well. Not to ignore the good within all of us, but wouldn’t it make sense if the ruler of this age was our natural human waywardness? Doesn’t it make sense that the sin we so readily shrug off is actually very much a part of who we are? The “that’s not who I am” is just a lie meant to make us feel better about the light within each one of us. Truth is, that particular sin (thought, intention or action) is deeply a part of who we are or were at the time. In the same way, can we not also be the evil one who brought us to that point in the first place?</p>

<p><strong>There is a light.</strong> Friends, I do believe in the goodness of mankind, but I have to temper that with the words of Jesus that say no one is good. Yes, there are evidences of God in each one of us, but all of us are tainted by imperfection and that’s fine. It’s how we deal with that imperfection that makes or breaks us. Whatever we do with it, the imperfection is still there.</p>

<p>The bottom line, whether you think I’m crazy or not, is we’re all in need of a Savior. Our nature to stray from good and seek immediate gratification is too great for us to overcome. Hearts are too flawed for everyone to just get a free pass to heaven. We need something more, something, <em>someone</em> to save us. That person is Jesus, God Himself. We need a faith that clings on to a hope for both today and eternity. We need a God who came down to this rock that can be cold and blustery and lived a life that ended in the perfect sacrifice that atoned for an eternity of wrongdoing. We need a God who loves us more than we could ever understand. And here He is. Selah.</p>

          <h2><a href="/elected/">elected</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p><strong>Elected.</strong> I breathed a sigh of relief Tuesday night when I learned the election had been called by the major networks. Why? Not because “my” candidate had won, but because this season of bickering and mudslinging was over. Then I read about the multiple meltdowns that occurred publicly on twitter that day and later into the night and I became a little sad once more. But, you know what? The sun rose the next morning.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[Jesus] is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation. For by him all things were created, in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities — all things were created through him and for him. — Colossians 1:15–16</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>In control.</strong> Yes, we as a country elected a man who may be more liberal than most conservative Christians would like, but the world has continued spinning, didn’t flip over on its axis, get swallowed into a black hole and hell didn’t (despite what the cooler temperatures might suggest) freeze over. Life continues today just as it did before this “most important” election. The people we elected were merely represented to national office. However, the true Sovereign reigns above them all, always has and always will. These people may have great influence even on the international scene, but even that is trumped by the fact that only God has rule over the planetary, even universal scene.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>First of all, then, I urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for all people, for kings and all who are in high positions, that we may lead a peaceful and quiet life, godly and dignified in every way. — 1 Timothy 2:1–2</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>True civic duty.</strong> Christians, friends, the passage above is our true civic duty. It’s more important than voting. We vote once a year, but we are called to pray for those elected officials <em>every day</em>. All. Officials. Paul in this letter makes no bones about political parties, nor does he even mention morality or faith. The exhortation is an imperative, therefore it’s asking for ongoing effort. I can’t tell you the last time I prayed even for the president, let alone the senators, representatives, etc. Do we have such little faith that we don’t believe God can have a hand in our politics?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Remind them to be submissive to rulers and authorities, to be obedient, to be ready for every good work, to speak evil of no one, to avoid quarreling, to be gentle, and to show perfect courtesy toward all people. — Titus 3:1–2</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From what little attention I intentionally paid to this election, I did not see a lot by which I was encouraged. In some cases, I don’t know who seemed more hateful, the Christians or the “heathens”. To be honest, I saw many people who didn’t believe God to be sovereign over the universe acting with more grace and composure than those who hold this belief. The fact is, if God is not bigger than the office of president of the United States, then who am I serving? If God is not bigger than one round of elections after so many others, then what is He bigger than? Let’s quit our bickering, moaning and griping. Instead, let’s pray for our <em>elected</em>.</p>

          <h2><a href="/politics-and-religion/">politics and religion</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p><strong>Politics and religion.</strong> Two topics we seem to avoid at the dinner table (most of us). Admittedly, I’d certainly fall into the camp of people who avoid politics, but for a different reason than the traditional. The election is tomorrow and honestly, I don’t care who you vote for. You could even make a case for not voting. However, I am highly ambivalent about this particular election’s outcome. Regardless of how the day ends, we still have a deeply broken system. We have a political system that wins votes through spreading hate from a deep-seated sense of fear of the “other”. Therefore, election ads devolve into nothing more than mudslinging and outright lies. All around us, we’re being bombarded by ads that berate the other side and scream in red white and blue to endorse a specific candidate. We are intellectually being bullied into voting, but <em>against</em> this “other”, rather than necessarily for something. In much the same way, we Christians present our religion to those around us; we try to bully our friends to vote against hell and damnation.</p>

<p><strong>Fear mongering.</strong> This seems to be a rather prevalent tactic in today’s society. We are all afraid of being wrong, of messing up. It seems that for many Christians, this results in a religion untouchable and unapproachable. We become hawkers of the anti-hell and spew hate on all those who may resist. We become aggressive and unloving. Our “witness” is nothing more than a stark contrast of the grace and mercy that forms the cornerstone of our faith.</p>

<p><strong>Us against them.</strong> This election has seen a few touchy “faith issues” take center stage. Abortion and gay marriage were two of the harder hit issues in the rhetoric leading up to the debates. We saw a black and white matter of faith, but there was a deeper story line unfolding. It was two sides fortifying their position against the other. Neither side could take a moderate stance on either issue as we had to create distance with the enemy. We had to define as clearly as possible the “them” in this scenario. Friends, in these two issues, the election became for many of us a battle against the baby killers and the homosexuals. But why?</p>

<p><strong>Running scared.</strong> Four years ago, we were promised hope (whether we agreed with Obama or not). He promised exactly what we wanted and needed. Four years later, he’s failed us in many ways. And we have no hope. In much the same way, we entered a relationship with Christ expecting a new golden age filled with happiness and laughter. Christ has failed us. Life is tough, the economy isn’t helping us out much and storms come and wipe away everything we knew. We’re beaten and battered. Jesus, why have You forsaken us?! We’re confused. Angry. We need somewhere to blow off steam.</p>

<p><strong>Mistaken promises.</strong> Unlike Obama, Christ never promised to fix our jobs, income, families, etc. No, He promised to fix our hearts. He promised to fix our personal economies. He promised to turn our worlds upside down. Jesus hasn’t failed us at all. In fact, He is making good on each and every promise He made. It is <em>us</em> in our fear and anger who have let Him down. It’s us who are spewing hate and engaging in the petty mudslinging and slapping His name at the tale end of our unsolicited ads. It’s us who have misrepresented our candidate. In His campaign, there is no room for fear and hate. Why? Because there is no room for darkness in the Light.</p>

<p>I’ve just committed a terrible social faux pas and spoken of both politics and religion at the proverbial dinner table. For that, I don’t apologize. They’re not topics to be avoided. Especially, when they’re so tied to who we are as a person and reflect the inner workings of how we think and relate. We are a sickly society and I think these two areas in particular showcase this sad fact. What can we do to change? Where do we go from here talking about <em>politics and religion</em>?</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p><strong>Aftermath of the storm.</strong> When I went to bed last night, I had a good (ominous, really) inkling I was in for a long night. After a day navigating the colliding winds of both the merriment of Halloween in the office and a looming sense of somberness, what more could I expect? Sandy had ceased her torment of the Mid-Atlantic several hours ago, but the pangs I felt of sympathy throbbed dull in my chest all day. The realization that while my personal bubble had not come close to popping, there were millions who couldn’t be any further from that reality. And then another realization set in.</p>

<p><strong>How little do I care.</strong> My entire concern throughout the storm was on my own comfort and enjoyment. Forget safety or well-being, I was trapped on the surface of my own ego. Yet, you have people fighting for their lives as well as the lives of everyone they loved. I know I cannot begin to understand, but I never even tried. Yet, this hurricane is no greater than what happens throughout the world every day. Hundreds of people die of starvation, thirst, fever, unending civil wars, terrorism. What percentage of the world lives below the poverty line? Somewhere along the line, I decided I could no longer be bothered to leave my bubble. Long ago, I willed my heart to become stone to those that needed a tender heart most.</p>

<p><strong>The least of these.</strong> This phrase has been abused so badly over the years that I don’t pretend any longer to know what it was meant to portray. Oddly, the happiest people I’ve met are the poorest financially, the least burdened with consumerist garbage. How can I call these happy souls least of anything? I know there are the destitute homeless, I’ve met a few. They’re homeless because they lost faith in the pillars of society (many of them vets of forgotten or hated wars) and society simply turned it’s back. Perhaps these are the least? What about me? What about the comfortable and miserable? What about those who have and continue to accrue, selling bits of their soul for each new lie? What about those who wake up at the end of their lives and lament the day they were born because they realize they’ve thrown away an entire life? <em>Surely, these are the least</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Drawing blood from a stone.</strong> This is the task I begin to endeavor, starting with this post. I’m tired of turning a blind eye to whole people groups in need of love and justice. I’m tired of considering those under the crushing burden of national debts “incurred” decades ago as nothing more than trivialities splashed across the front page of my newspaper. I’m tired of searching for a pulse and finding none. I’m tired of a heart that feels nothing anymore. I want to hurt for these people. I want to bleed. I want the pain that reminds me from time to time that I’m alive. One day, I hope to be as alive as those with smiles on their faces as they live on a landfill. Won’t you join me?</p>

          <h2><a href="/living-with-a-stranger/">living with a stranger</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p><strong>Living with a stranger.</strong> The lease is nearing it’s term, so it was time for my roommate and me to talk about what we were going to do. Either we were both signing for another year, one was leaving, or both were leaving. In the midst of this conversation, I realized the person on the other side of the table, one the other side of the conversation was a near complete stranger. I have spent almost ten months sleeping, door unlocked next to a stranger, cohabiting with this person and trusting him in all sorts of ways. I left the conversation with a good understanding that he wasn’t going to sign another lease in this building. But, I also walked away with a sense that I was to blame for the fact that I was having the conversation with a stranger.</p>

<p><strong>The stranger next door.</strong> So, we “met” through Craigslist and my qualifications as stated to my friends and family were that the guy didn’t appear to be a chainsaw murderer. Oh, he also had a penchant for cleanliness. We’d started hanging out with one another at random times once we first moved in together at the very end of last December. January was exciting as I’d found a roommate and a new friend. He was called away for business during the next couple months and I did some traveling of my own. The next eight months or so went by without so much as a whimper. Next thing I knew, I was having a conversation about extending a lease with the enigma of a roommate.</p>

<p><strong>Where’s the big picture?</strong> Here I am today typing to you about a roommate, but I’m really not. Yes, I’m literally talking about a guy with whom I’ve been sharing an apartment, but I’m talking about so much more. If you caught the illusion earlier, I’m referring to your neighbor. I’m referring to people with whom you come into contact, whether it be on a daily or even an infrequent basis. I’m talking about family or stranger, male or female, attractive or homely. I’m talking about wasted opportunities at relationships and making an impact in our worlds.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But [the lawyer], desiring to justify himself, said to Jesus, “And who is my neighbor?” Jesus replied, “A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and he fell among robbers, who stripped him and beat him and departed, leaving him half dead. Now by chance a priest was going down that road, and when he saw him he passed by on the other side. So likewise a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side. But a Samaritan, as he journeyed, came to where he was, and when he saw him, he had compassion. He went to him and bound up his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he set him on his own animal and brought him to an inn and took care of him. And the next day he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper, saying, ‘Take care of him, and whatever more you spend, I will repay you when I come back.’ Which of these three, do you think, proved to be a neighbor to the man who fell among the robbers?” He said, “The one who showed him mercy.” And Jesus said to him, “You go, and do likewise.” — Luke 10:29–37</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Going, going, gone.</strong> This opportunity hasn’t been wasted completely and I have about two months to accomplish something with it. But, how often to we have such extended contact with people? Most of the people we meet, we have on the order of minutes, hours if we’re fortunate. What time is there to waste? What people are there who are undeserving of grace which we were undeserving to receive from God? Better yet, how much more deserving do they need to be? No, it’s not that we’ve been denied opportunities in this life. The fact of the matter is, we’ve buried our heads in the sand ignoring they even exist.</p>

<p>This isn’t the only opportunity I’ve passed up in my life. There have been many, but I found this one poignant and timely for me. What is that story for you? We all are looking to make an impact in the world. We’re all looking to start a revolution, big or small, and change the world. What I’ve realized is it’s easier than I ever thought. You don’t have to convert the masses. You don’t have to turn water into wine or a few fish into thousands. It takes letting one person know you care. It takes one act, conversation or gesture. Boom, the revolution’s begun. You may not see it then, but soon enough it’ll take root both in you and around you. You’ll see you’re amongst friends as opposed to <em>living with a stranger</em>.</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p><strong>Deep divide.</strong> We live in a rather binary society. If you’re not one, you’re the other. If you’re not with us, you’re against us. We’re also in a time where to be on that other side can have grave results. You have one side assuring you they’re the answer. You have the other side venemously pointing out the first’s flawed track record. Each side interrupts the other, tries to speak above the other and as a result, nothing gets heard in the shouting match. Insults, belittlement, war analogies aplenty ensue.</p>

<p><strong>The ugly in the mirror.</strong> What I described would aptly fit with the presidential debates. However, would it not fit just as well as a description of the Church today? Maybe your church doesn’t do this and I’m really grateful for it. Maybe your church does it passive aggressively and you’re not aware of it. The various neighborhoods or towns within the Kingdom are all fighting for the honor of the “best place to live”. However, we’re going about it by spurning all others despite claiming the same allegiance and similar missions. We are nothing more than bickering children fighting for a father’s love, but our Father has more than enough to go around.</p>

<p><strong>Pick your battles.</strong> So, I’ve belonged to the denomination of non-denominational churches pretty much all my life. Infer all you want at this point, but that only serves to prove my point here. We fight over things such as predestination, what the time after the return of Jesus will look like, how and how often to perform the Lord’s Supper. Looking over that list, I’m appalled. While we’re at it, we might as well just fight over the locations in which services can be held and the allowable color palette for a church building. What is it we’re fighting over here? Are the things over which we’re ready to condemn others’ souls weighty enough that souls are actually on the line? I’ve never been to heaven or hell, but I can’t imagine any of the aforementioned issues was a deciding factor. Friends, <em>we’ve made mountains out of molehills</em> (to borrow a phrase from an old friend).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We believe in one God, <br />
the Father, the Almighty, <br />
maker of heaven and earth, <br />
of all that is, seen and unseen.<br />
 <br />
We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ, <br />
the only Son of God, <br />
eternally begotten of the Father, <br />
God from God, light from light, <br />
true God from true God, <br />
begotten, not made, <br />
of one Being with the Father; <br />
through him all things were made. <br />
For us and for our salvation <br />
he came down from heaven, <br />
was incarnate of the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary <br />
and became truly human. <br />
For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate; <br />
he suffered death and was buried. <br />
On the third day he rose again <br />
in accordance with the Scriptures; <br />
he ascended into heaven <br />
and is seated at the right hand of the Father. <br />
He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead, <br />
and his kingdom will have no end.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life, <br />
who proceeds from the Father [and the Son], <br />
who with the Father and the Son is worshiped and glorified, <br />
who has spoken through the prophets. <br />
We believe in one holy catholic and apostolic Church. <br />
We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins. <br />
We look for the resurrection of the dead, <br />
and the life of the world to come. Amen.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>What matters?</strong> I think the ultimate litmus test to answer this question is to ask about an issue if one’s soul is at stake. If a matter amounts to endangering the eternal well being of an individual, then it is of the gravest importance. Otherwise, whatever floats your boat, but I do hope there is an ounce of Biblical truth to go along with that floating. Calling Jesus a prophet and a good man, nothing more, now that would be an issue. Debating over which cross was actually used in His crucifixion: get over it. Again, take a minute and determine the true stakes of the issue at hand. Soul? Fight. Anything less? Debate, <em>calmly</em>.</p>

<p>Maybe <em>I’m</em> the one making much out of nothing, but you tell me. Maybe <em>I’m</em> the one about whom I complain (and I am). Maybe it’s you, too. Maybe we need to love those who are also trying to spread the hope and joy of Christ. We all have our unique faith stories and have come to different conclusions. Is it not better that the Gospel is being spread and shared? Paul seemed to think so, but that was before today’s <em>deep divide</em>.</p>

          <h2><a href="/hearts-will-shatter/">hearts will shatter</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p><strong>Hearts will shatter.</strong> I’ll keep this brief, but I’m finally coming back to the forty-three question monster of a post that was. However, I’m going to attempt a somewhat far-fetched tie in, so beware.</p>

<p><strong>Revisiting the questions.</strong> Admittedly, I haven’t being doing the homework I assigned. However, from what I have finished, I realized my deepest fear is being left alone, abandoned by those who I love most. It’s a crippling fear that stymies relationships of all kinds, especially my relationship with God. I don’t know what that might look like, but I’d imagine that place would be hell. So, I distrust to my core.</p>

<p><strong>Peel back the layers.</strong> The truth is, I’ve been hurt too many times by too many people in too many different capacities. I’ve had my heart wrung and smashed violently like crystal upon the rocks of love. And I am often too blind by fear of the pain to see beyond it. I’ve carried around the agony for years, like a lead weight in my chest. I have walked into the jail cell of safety and security and wallowed in my hopeless, safe seclusion.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said: ‘Blessed are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of God. Blessed are you who are hungry now, for you shall be satisfied. Blessed are you who weep now, for you shall laugh. Blessed are you when people hate you and when they exclude you and revile you and spurn your name as evil, on account of the Son of Man! Rejoice in that day, and leap for joy, for behold, your reward is great in heaven; for so their fathers did to the prophets.’” Luke 6:20–23</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Connecting the dots.</strong> What I heard echoing in these poignant verses is that the Kingdom is for those who’ve been broken, bruised, crushed and trampled. The Kingdom is reserved for those who’ve abandoned themselves to love and carelessly run from safety. It is for those unafraid to feel, in all the spectrum of emotions. It is for the meek, not the cautious. It is for the crazy, those who believe that through it all, God is strong enough to keep them upright. The Kingdom is made up of those who dare to endeavor the trust fall, letting God be bigger than any heartbreak or circumstance.</p>

<p>Daily, we have a choice between safety and danger. Every day, we can retreat into the solitary confinement of security or we can fling ourselves headfirst into the wild uncertainty that is God. We can embrace the stuffed toy of American Jesus, or we can be overwhelmed in the sea of grace of Yahweh. I’ll tell you, friends, I’m tired of the boyfriend Jesus that’s cute, hair perfectly quaffed, predictable. Give me pain. Give me the rocks. Because once the pieces of your heart have been put back together, you’ll always find extra rot that you never knew you were carrying around. However, I can’t trust a god I can fit my arms around with such a task. No, I need a big, wild God who He Himself is abandoned to love. Because, Christian, <em>hearts will shatter</em>.</p>

          <h2><a href="/piercing-silences/">piercing silences</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p><strong>Piercing silences.</strong> Most of us don’t do well with breaks in conversation. Usually, it’s referred to as the “awkward” silence. I’ve had one that’s nearly lasted four days now. This may sound a little ridiculous, but my iPod broke Monday when I was ironically trying to <em>fix</em> it by resetting it at work and the work computer froze. I’ve had no music at work and even less (it seems) for my commutes. For someone who lives to a soundtrack, this silence sends me crashing about for earplugs. It’s deafening. So, yesterday I decided to confront the silence head on and turn off the radio for my drive home.</p>

<p><strong>Retreating to the noise.</strong> I couldn’t stay silent for more than a few seconds. Even when I was “silent”, I was spending that time trying to shed the onslaught of thoughts like a duck’s feathers do water. I’d failed. When I could no longer take it, I gave in to my defeat. It wasn’t until reading later on in the evening I understood better why it’d been so hard. It wasn’t until later that I realized why finishing the forty-three questions in last week’s post has been so elusive. It wasn’t until last night that I realized <em>I’m naked</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Technically speaking.</strong> It’s the reason we’re so attached to our iPhones, TVs, social media, etc. We’re terrified of confronting the darkness within. We’re terrified of silence because silence brings us to those places and we’re afraid we might not return. My iPod was a means of taking meaningful time alone in the car and wasting it being tranquilized by the melodic tunes that were stored upon it. It was a retreat from the cold world outside. It was my escape from the meaningful. Not always, but many times. But I, we are not the first to do this. <em>Why should we be different?</em></p>

<p><strong>The man who fought with God.</strong> Maybe some of you are not familiar with the story of Jacob, but he was a twerp in the Bible. His life story is wrought with cheating people and being cheated. There comes a time in his life when he’s done and he goes to return to Esau, his brother whom he cheated out of his birthright for a bowl of soup and whose inheritance he stole. Jacob realizes he doesn’t have any other choice, so he goes and the night before confronting his brother, he sleeps alone as he’s sent the rest of his entourage on. That night, he spends it wrestling with a man in the dark. The entire night, Jacob engages in hand-to-hand combat with a nondescript stranger. Right before sunrise, the man tries to escape from Jacob, but only by hitting below the belt (in the hip). Jacob asks the man for a blessing and the man turns, telling him that he already has been blessed and will be called Israel. Then, it is morning and the man is gone.</p>

<p><strong>Back to the darkness.</strong> That night, Jacob finally wrestled with his own demons. He went to the mat with his life and his faith. The only problem for us today is that to do that, Jacob had to venture into the darkness. Nothing that has to do with God is dark in Christian-ese. Yet, to deal with his brokenness and doubt, Jacob had no choice but to go into darkness and <em>alone</em>. Not only this, but he appeared to his family the next day wounded. Jacob limped for the rest of his life. We don’t like darkness. We don’t like being alone. And we <em>really</em> don’t like hurt. Yet, in this story, all are holy. All are just part of the journey God laid out for Jacob. They are all along the path that leads to Israel, he who fought with God. In the end, Israel is <em>whole</em>, <em>weathered</em> and <em>purposed</em>. <em>He is not who he was</em>.</p>

<p>Jacob isn’t punished for wrestling with God, instead he’s blessed. It’s to be noted that it’s not unnecessary pugilism, but a deep willingness to be open with God and try to understand Him. Thousands of years later, we forget this story as we’re too busy consuming status updates, food, clothing, significant others, promotions. We’re more content in the third of an inch deep pool of our iPhones than our spiritual health and general wellness. To be honest, it makes sense we’re so infatuated with thinner devices as they begin to mirror the depths of our souls. Each day they’re getting shallower as we avoid the <em>piercing silences</em>.</p>

          <h2><a href="/the-discipline-of-solitude/">the discipline of solitude</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p><strong>The discipline of solitude.</strong> I hate being alone. Being alone signifies loneliness, being deserted. Therefore, while I have times where I am physically alone, I’m never really alone. There is always something like activity, the TV, music, a show, etc. to keep me safe from this terrifying proposition. It wasn’t until last week that I began to realize this and just how far down it had spread in my being.</p>

<p><strong>Peter Pan culture.</strong> We treasure youth and vitality. So much so, that we allow middle-aged men and women to act as children without so much as batting an eye. We value this youth over true health, but why? We have lost faith in the pillars of society such as government and traditional values and all we need hope, so we find that in empty and often misleading success and vitality. Yet, they only go skin deep. To go any further would bring up things that would only serve to damper that dimly glimmering hope; looking too closely at our hearts can only slow us down.</p>

<p><strong>Time in the desert.</strong> What do the stories of Moses, Paul, Jesus and John the Baptist all have in common? Before they could begin their ministry, before they could begin living out their ultimate purposes, they had to spend varying times in the desert. <em>Alone</em>. I read this last week and immediately shrugged off this fact. That’s when it hit me: we’ve lost the ability to be brave and willingly walk out into the desert. Why? We know that we will have to face our demons, the devil, satan, evil, whatever you want to call it. And we don’t know if we’ll make it back out alive.</p>

<p><strong>Why the desert?</strong> First of all, we are confronting our innermost issues. We need a place where we have the space and quiet to undertake this process. Also, we need to be alone. It’s your heart here, no one else’s. You’re not alone. I just contradicted myself, but really I didn’t. Physically, we are alone, but God is right with us in this process. Step by step, he does not forsake. Finally, purposeful people aren’t pieces of men and women carrying around boulders of doubt and guilt. No, they are whole with lightened loads (notice I didn’t say they were <em>without</em>).</p>

<p><strong>Where have we strayed?</strong> Admitting imperfection today is merely a coverup to hide what’s really going on in our hearts. Truly inspecting our brokenness, we would serve to undermine the hope and strength we cherish in the individual. Seeing that we are cracked and torn takes a jackhammer to the new pillar of our society. Admitting that the almighty <em>I</em> is but a facade, is telling the emperor he has no clothes. No one wants to be that person. Yet, is imperfection weakness? Is desiring to fix it and be whole an act of cowardice?</p>

<p>Give me weakness. If the answers to these questions are “yes,” then I have only the words of Paul for you, “…Therefore I will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may rest upon me.” (II Corinthinans 12:9b) I boast because I’ve seen that only through the acknowledgment of weakness can it be overcome by the grace and mercy of God. Only by seeing weakness for what it truly is can we appreciate strength. The only caveat is to get there, it requires the <em>discipline of solitude</em>.</p>

          <h2><a href="/religion-fails/">religion fails</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p><strong>Religion fails.</strong> Every time. No matter what, religion itself will fail. See, I wanted to continue the topic from Monday’s post on <a href="http://104.193.143.57/~waywar13/ce/2012/10/08/bite-sized-questions/" title="Bite-Sized Questions">Bite-Sized Questions</a>, but with the releasing of the most recent <a href="http://www.pewforum.org/uploadedFiles/Topics/Religious_Affiliation/Unaffiliated/NonesOnTheRise-full.pdf">Pew Report on religious affiliation</a> being brought up several times in the past 48 hours as well as reading through a book called “Wrestling With God” by Rick Diamond,I had no choice but to delve into the fray.</p>

<p><strong>We are not our grandparents.</strong> We are not a generation who adheres to the stoic, hold the course values of our grandparents. Whereas they value commitment and unwavering loyalty, we are apt to question. They upheld the values of their families and often built upon them, immersing themselves in their occupations and family traditions.</p>

<p><strong>We are not our parents.</strong> We are not better off than our parents were. Where our parents saw a world of opportunity when they graduated from college (if they did), we see a barren landscape of half-offers and interviews. Where they experienced success and a growing plenty, we are reminded that there isn’t as much. They experienced the booms, but we’ve seen more of the busts.</p>

<p><strong>A generation disenfranchised.</strong> We’ve seen many things in our brief lives go up in smoke. As a result, we can’t simply take what we’ve been given without a healthy dose of questioning. We will look that gift horse in the mouth. And we’ve begun to do that with our religious beliefs. Surprise, surprise, we’re falling out of love with the blind devotion that satisfied scores of generations before us. It’s an issue that’s been with us since at least the times of the Bible.</p>

<p><strong>Blind religion.</strong> What I’m mentioning here is a faith in something for the sake of faith. To get more specific, the Christian Church has been suffering from this malady for the past several decades. It has been easier to look around the room, ask if everyone is “fine” and walk away. It is much harder to dive into the details of life with someone and check the wellness of each individual component. Yet, with the rapid advances in wealth and technology, we could afford this luxury of emotional space.</p>

<p><strong>The blaring alarm.</strong> It’s been going off for some time. Church attendance has generally been in decline for some time now. The sleeping giant is slowly waking. It’s realizing that a feel-good anesthesia isn’t what the upcoming generations want. We want purpose, meaning and a truth that stands against the cold winds of corporate greed and terrorist attacks. We want something to buffet us against the inevitable failures of the world system. However, if you don’t give us something real, unlike generations before, we will outright refuse to accept it.</p>

<p>This is not an emergency, but a call to arms. It’s a wake up call to people committing wrong in the name of Right. While the Church has always been human, therefore it’s failed many times over, it has not always been inhumane in protesting soldiers’ funerals and committing acts of terrorism in protest of abortions. People aren’t looking for a perfect club or organization. People want a visceral group of awakened individuals gutting out the battles of life in the grime of the trenches together. People aren’t looking for Oz, they’re looking for a clan of their own. We all want to belong, but to something real and the Church has gotten away from that last aspect. It’s not so much about how we act, but how we react to our inevitable failures. Without it, our churches, like our faiths, will be empty. Alone, <em>religion fails</em>.</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p>For those of you faithful journeyers (I’m using this term henceforth), you may have been a tad alarmed when you didn’t see this post around 8AM this morning. No worries, all is well. Or, should I say things are as well as they can be for one contemplating his very being. I’m continuing the question I asked in the last post, <a href="http://104.193.143.57/~waywar13/ce/2012/10/04/who-are-you/" title="Who Are You?">“Who are you?”</a><br />
Are you willing to walk all the way down this road? If not, I understand, but please don’t read any further. It’ll only serve to jolt you from where you are and when you do decide to go no further, you’ll only be lost, that much further from what you knew. The rest, don’t read on without a pen and paper, or copying the coming questions into a document where you can record the answers. Yes, I’m inviting you on this journey of discovery with me. Yes, for the majority of you, it’s evening and the dull roar of your day is quieting down and you are ready to be vulnerable with yourselves, raw.<br />
Here come the questions. But in asking the overarching, we have to break it down into manageable chunks. That is why there are as many questions as there are below. Answer them at your own pace. But, answer them and answer them truthfully. The future of your world depends particularly on the latter. So, hold your nose, because here comes the cold water…</p>

<p>1. What are the major events in my life that have led me to this point? In other words, what’s my <em>story</em>?</p>

<p>2. Of those events, do I see a trend of negative/positive events that suggest <em>patterns</em> worth changing or taking a closer look at?</p>

<p>3. Am I generally content with where I am now?</p>

<p>4. What do I like the <em>least</em> about myself (personality that is)?</p>

<p>5. What caused me to act in this way? What event or family pattern led me to think this is a normal behavior or defend myself in this way?</p>

<p>11. What overlap do I see in my own personality? What reactionary/self-defense personality traits have I acquired over the years against my dad?</p>

<p>12. How would I describe my mom’s personality? Do I know my mom at this <strong>depth</strong>?</p>

<p>13. What overlap do I see in my own personality? What reactionary/self-defense personality traits have I acquired over the years against my mom?</p>

<p>14. Do I have siblings? If so, repeat the last couple questions for each sibling.</p>

<p>15(ish). What do I value more, alone time or time with people? If people, do I prefer one-on-one or group settings?</p>

<p>16. Do I value <em>facts</em> or am I more intrigued by the possibility of <em>theories</em>?</p>

<p>17. Look at an object in front of you. Describe it. Did you point out a characteristic of it or did you just say what it was or try to use metaphor?</p>

<p>18. When I think about a group, do I relate to it as a single entity or as a conglomeration of individuals?</p>

<p>19. If I could be <em>anything</em> professionally, what would I be?</p>

<p>20. What about that job <em>excites</em> me most?</p>

<p>21. Why haven’t I pursued it?</p>

<p>34. <em>Am I?</em></p>

<p>35. Do I have a <strong>personal</strong> relationship with God?</p>

<p>36. Why?</p>

<p>44. <strong>Live it.</strong></p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p><strong>Who are you?</strong> I’ll get back to that question, but first, I need to warm up to it. Here’s a completely different question: what do you do? It’s a very simple, straightforward question. Yet, every time I’m asked, it causes me to take pause. But why? I’m just being asked to describe what I do from Monday to Friday around the hours of nine to five. You see, it’s just not that simple. Regardless of the asker, I have to impress them just a little while feigning modesty. I got a job that fits me, that exudes who I am and I’m going to have to let you have it when you walk into that trap of my awesomeness.</p>

<p><strong>Returning back to earth.</strong> So, that was a little dramatic, but I think you get the point. Somewhere along the line, an identity has been forged out of a mere occupation. Entire lives are lived based on this thought when a career merely points toward who someone is, wants to be or wants others to believe they are. I think I fall into the latter trap, but really I should be focusing on my job giving a little insight into who I am. Now, I could be wrong, but I think our grandparents got this. They took jobs that they didn’t necessarily love (but didn’t really hate, either) because they knew it was just what they had to do.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“You need to figure out who you are.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Blurring the lines.</strong> The statement above sent me into a tizzy of mental activity. A simple statement from my dad sent me reeling and that’s when it happened. I answered “Who am I?” with the question “What do I want to be when I grow up?” I answered with what I wanted to do for a living to the question of my being. It wasn’t until eating breakfast this morning that the gravity of this misperception begun to hit me.</p>

<p><strong>Characters without a script.</strong> People who don’t actively know who they are resemble actors on a stage who haven’t read their own back stories. They may nail the lines, but they are playing a different part altogether from the one they were cast. Sure, we may be living great lives, doing great things, but at the end of the day, we may be selling ourselves short on what God made us to be. Why? Because we didn’t take the time to ask Him? No, because we didn’t take the time to listen.</p>

<p><strong>Busyness is currency.</strong> We’re too busy with our jobs, personas, social lives to slow down for that. We have time to complain, but no time for a quick word from our Maker. We can spend an entire weekend watching football only leaving the couch for beer, food or the bathroom, yet tuning into God is always getting rescheduled. How far have <em>I</em>, have <em>we</em> fallen? Where are our priorities? The bigger question is, for what are we compensating?</p>

<p>God only made whole people with well-defined back stories and brilliant identities defined in Himself. Yet, somewhere along the line we decided that wasn’t enough. We came to the conclusion that we were incomplete and so we found something to fill the “void”. My career isn’t big enough for that hole and it probably isn’t big enough for yours, either. I ask you the same question I’m asking myself, “Who told you that you were insufficient?” The answer that rings in my head is “I made you to be complete.” Is it too much to stop our frenetic break-neck pace and listen to the One from who we get our identity? Is it too much to listen to the One who’s been trying to answer all along <em>who are you</em>?</p>

          <h2><a href="/whats-wrong-with-sex/">what’s wrong with sex?</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p><strong>What’s wrong with sex?</strong> Now that I have your attention, I am, you are, he is, she is, we all are. Why? Because some time ago, someone in some tall tower decided that sex would be best thought of as bad. So, now everyone I can think of goes around (whether they have sex or not) treating sex as a dirty thing. Now, you have the married couples who have and enjoy sex in the Biblical way, but not even they seem to like to talk about it. Then, you have the couples who are having sex unmarried and I’d be floored if I heard too many of them even venturing toward that topic openly. You also have the promiscuous singles who’ve had sex to varying degrees and the only time you’ll hear about sex there is as a sort of primal contest of manliness. Then, you have the good boys and girls who wouldn’t go near the sex, let alone utter a word in its direction.</p>

<p><strong>Sex sells.</strong> Consider this Exhibit A in the evidence supporting that we as a society think sex to be dirty. Like the fruit in the Garden, there is at least an air wrongdoing that entices us inextricably. There is something intrinsically sexy about sex. Therefore, men and women are all drawn to it. Just spitballing, but it could be simply a result of the fact that we were made sexual creatures. However, we’ve never really figured out what to do with or make of that fact other than babies.</p>

<p><strong>We’re failing.</strong> I mean this of the Church, primarily, but also of society as a whole. For heaven’s sake, there’s an entire book of the Bible dedicated to a couple and the bulk of the narrative centers around them making love. It’s not some erotic analogy for the church. There are some things you may be able to stretch in that direction, but when it starts talking about how beautiful the woman’s navel is, I think the analogy dies right there. In spite of this, we the Church deem sex as evil, dirty, filthy, etc. and somehow a magic wand is waved on our wedding day and *<em>poof</em>* it’s made beautiful and sacred. Huh? So, what am I supposed to have been doing with these past near twenty-five years of my life?</p>

<p><strong>The conversation’s begun.</strong> Yes, there’s been more and more conversation in churches about this dirty little act, but I think we’ve still a ways to go. What do I mean? The biggest concern I have (maybe it’s because it directly affects me) is that the only answer college students and young professionals seems to get in regards to sexuality is to get married. So, since those things happened physically and biologically around thirteen up until now, I’m supposed to do what? Silence. I think this is the most important question right now. People for various reasons are waiting longer and longer to get married. Therefore, that time before marriage is also longer and the temptation to indulge in the dirty sex is that much greater, if only prolonged. Where is our answer?</p>

<p><strong>It’s a murky water.</strong> The fact is, there isn’t a whole lot in the Bible for the single people. For the record, I don’t believe the answer is free love. It isn’t masturbation and it isn’t feigning sexual ignorance. We have to find a way to embrace and cultivate our individual sexualities. We need to be in environments that acknowledge that we are becoming sexual beings <em>before</em> we’re married and that period of time is only growing nowadays. We need to be free to explore and understand the implications of this, but in a healthy way. I’m sure it’s happening somewhere, but I just don’t see it. We can’t play ostrich to sex until the day we’re married. Sex was never meant to work that way.</p>

<p>I’m not giving you an answer, I know. I’m sorry, but I’m twenty-four and I’m in the thick of it. I can’t imagine how difficult it is for the ladies, but I do know how difficult it is for the men, so I have a reference point. Why is sex, what God calls good and beautiful, made out as dirty? Why are we the Church seeming to lead this wayward charge? Yes, I agree we’ve swung back from this crusade (too soon?), but there’s much work yet to be done. We’re missing the key to our answer and that is to address those singles, before their married and in over their heads. We need to educate in much the same way we do learning Scripture. If our bodies are to be living sacrifices, then aren’t our sexual desires also to be? Instead, they’re treated like sin, shut in a closet until it rears its ugly head and we are left denying it a part of our existence once again. So again I ask, “<strong>What’s wrong with sex?</strong>”</p>

          <h2><a href="/when-passions-collide/">when passions collide</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p><strong>When passions collide.</strong> Everyone wants their passions to be their life’s work; the intersection of passions and vocation is a beautiful place. I am no exception, however I’d add that I’d like that space to also include making good money as well. In pursuit of this place, I’ve merely floated the past few months. I’ve been exploring options, not willing to commit to one or the other so as not to miss out on any opportunity at all. However, the last few months in seeming reaction to my flightiness presented no such opportunities and I left for Europe frustrated, unfulfilled, deeply unsettled. It was there I realized a simple truth.</p>

<p><strong>We cannot do it all.</strong> Given the content of this blog, you’d think I might have come across this before, and you’re right. However, it wasn’t until a quiet moment of clarity on a train somewhere in Europe that it stuck. I have a day job and I have a couple hobbies. Outside of the hours of nine to five, I am both a writer and a singer/songwriter. To run ahead full steam with both and try to have a social life, I’ve been languishing in the dissatisfaction of all three areas. No, I’d have to choose where I wanted to focus my attentions. The people, however, could not be done away with.</p>

<p><strong>Weighing the costs.</strong> It wasn’t a decision I wanted to make, because each represents a tantalizing realm of possibilities and so my heart was torn. I wanted my cake, but I wanted to eat it as well. I couldn’t. However, for those of you who know me, I had to understand that music is something that runs in my veins. I had to come to terms with the fact that while I wanted to give up nothing, I had to be true to who I was made to be. I had to listen to a heart coming to life. But, I also had to acknowledge I was choosing the path dim and foggy, fraught with uncertainty and unknowns.</p>

<p><strong>I don’t need to know.</strong> Life as I’ve come to know it is a journey. Insomuch, I don’t need to know the destination as that’d only serve to cheapen the journey itself. See, if I believe God has made me the way He did with the passions He has, then I also have to believe He made me to use them and will provide a way for that. If He’s providing a way, then He must know where it leads as He’s the One providing. If He has given me all this, then who am I to question the gift? He has led me this far without harm, therefore I cannot think why I should believe He won’t continue to do the same moving forward. I cannot think why I shouldn’t trust Him with each individual step along the journey. He <em>has</em> never let me down and He <em>will</em> never.</p>

<p>We will come across many new and shiny opportunities in life, but most of the time they are only meant to distract us from who we are. They are mere flashbangs in a war for our heart. Inevitably, there comes a time when we must ignore them and focus only on what’s important, but we have to evaluate that for ourselves in the context of who we are. We must choose between a life of comfort and a life of gritty effectuality. Sometimes, the choice isn’t as clear cut and we get confused. God is not a God of confusion. If we are earnest and patient, He will never disappoint. Most of all, He will never let us down. It’s up to us to come to Him <em>when passions collide</em>.</p>

          <h2><a href="/zombies-exist/">zombies exist</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p><strong>Zombies exist.</strong> You may be thinking this is some sort of gimmick to get people to read this blog, but that’s missing the mark here. No, this starts with a simple question at a table of unknowns in Amsterdam, when the host of the house in which we were staying asked me, “So where does that leave you, spiritually?” The <em>that</em> she was referring to was my faith given the differences in that of my father and mother and the why was because I had just finished giving my life story to a table of strangers. So, I told them that in a nutshell, I am an evangelical who has arrived at that conclusion through much doubt and questioning, but I don’t consider myself among mainstream American masses.</p>

<p><strong>Most Hindus don’t know what they believe.</strong> These words came in the car as I rode along with a Hindu coworker to work with a few servers off-location. “That’s the same for every religion, isn’t it?” I countered. “Yeah, I guess you’re right,” he agreed. This dialogue is rather telling and even more disturbing, if you begin to think into the ramifications. There are few things more dangerous than people running around blindly committing acts in the name of Allah, Yahweh or insert the name of another god here. Yet, millions of people do just this. I know, because <strong>I have been one of them</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>We wrap ourselves in a faith cocoon.</strong> It’s easier to put our faith in something that comforts us than it is to put our faith in that which challenges us and makes us uncomfortable at times. We want an elixir for the pains of this world and religion is a powerful one. Rather than <em>be</em> well, we settle for <em>feeling</em> well. We use faith simply to coddle our existences, therefore there’s no need to delve into it, because then we might be forced to confront who we are truly without the rose colored glasses. That is <em>supremely</em> uncomfortable.</p>

<p><strong>Religion as a drug.</strong> I begin to understand Karl Marx’s words “religion is the opiate of the masses” as I look back over the past few years. I ran to religion in college because it was the only thing left that I hadn’t tried after my parents separated. I wasn’t so concerned with what was believed, so long as I believed, felt connected with a community and felt better. I was calling it religion, but all I wanted was the good feeling I had associated with it. So, I languished inside for years until I let faith get uncomfortable. Faith got personal and now I know I can never be the same.</p>

<p><strong>Where are the zombies?</strong> Think about what a zombie is and then consider one who practices a set of cultic acts like going to church once a week and attending a small group without understanding or caring why they do it. I can’t find a real difference other than the mastication of brains. We have gotten complacent in our faiths and that has led us to lethargy and lethargy to a pretty form of zombification. There is no heart, there is no compassion only empty smiles and divorce. We have taken Jesus out of our faith and replaced Him with Xanax.</p>

<p>It’s only now that I start to see the foolishness of my ways the past few years. It’s only once I took an inch back from the familiar that I was able to reflect clearly upon a life unlived. It took a trip thousands of miles away for blood to commence pumping through a heart that had iced over from disuse. I have been performing the empty motions for too long, but I am now awakening and I have ceased silencing a heart screaming for life. I can no longer roam this life blindly, thoughtlessly not wanting to know more about the One in whom my faith is placed. I am finished living as a real zombie. Are you?</p>

          <h2><a href="/myself-when-i-am-real/">myself when i am real</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p><strong>Myself when I am real.</strong> Today is a big day for me. It marks the first day of the rest of my life. Technically, so has every other day, but this is a special morning. I’m back from Europe and the normal, everyday life I left behind for two weeks is once again my reality. Today marks the transition from one season of growth and rebirth, to the next. Today is the day I begin to find out who I am in the context of the “real world”, only now I am real, too.</p>

<p><strong>Coming off the retreat high.</strong> For those of you that have ever been to a church or youth group retreat, summer camp, etc., you know this feeling. Everything in life feels different and you’re ready to be the new, improved you that the world outside of the microcosm of that shared experience has seen. Only, two weeks later you find yourself worn back to the old you by the stresses and burdens of life. You’re on fire, but the world quickly extinguishes you as if afraid you’ll catch all of it with your flame.</p>

<p><strong>Leaving the old behind.</strong> As a believer in Jesus Christ, I know that I have been made a new creation, but allow me to clarify this oft quoted, little understood cliche. I do not leave behind who I was and have been. No, I carry those scars along with me to remind me from where God has taken me and the growth for which He’s graciously allowed along the way. However, the newness of my creation comes from the fact that while those scars help with recognition, they do not define me any longer. What defines me, the <em>only</em> thing that defines me, is my hope through faith and love in Christ.</p>

<p><strong>Building an altar.</strong> Oftentimes, especially in the Old Testament (less famous with us postmoderns), when people wanted to remember God, or when God wanted them to remember Him, an altar would be built. Whether I like it or not, an altar is being built today. I finally get the chance to weather the rest of the storm created by my DUI arrest that took place a couple months ago. It is a day I shall not soon forget, but not because of the imminent storm. No, I will remember this day because of the grace that God has shown me in the last two weeks and the grace I will be shown not long from now. Without going too deep, God’s grace will be manifested in giving me whatever punishment I need and nothing else. This, yes, <em>this</em> is grace.</p>

<p><strong>Cautious steps.</strong> If for a moment I come off as unafraid, you have read me wrong, my friend. I am scared. Very. However, I know that my fear is only an exaggeration of a dirty lie. God is good, I said that last week. But, God is also sovereign and always has been. But, God is good in His sovereignty which is the connection sometimes I have a hard time making. God has been watching over this process since before I saw it happening and all the while He’s been providing. Timid, I am, but confident that when I step into that courtroom, nothing that He hasn’t planned for my good and His will befall me.</p>

<p>All too easily the real world gets us down. We have experiences that change us, but they don’t stick when we return to the familiar drudgery of the everyday. The mundane acid washes our faith, erasing all signs of the recent growth so only the old, complacent remains. However, this is the first sign of death. This is the early warning that the life we claimed to have gained or regained is hanging off our bones. For this, we have to fight. Not with fists, because satan is too strong for that. Instead, we fight with the Word, prayer and community. We fight with every weapon God has given us, including Himself. And in that day, we build an altar to remind ourselves of God’s love and goodness. We remember the darkness from whence we were delivered. Finally, we take the cautious but deliberate steps into the future unknown, armed with this empowering knowledge. Ask yourself, who am I <em>when I am real</em>?</p>

          <h2><a href="/god-loves-me/">god loves me</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p><strong>God loves me.</strong> A crisp, distinctly German feel adorned a beautiful morning. We were waiting on yet another early train to whisk us away to another destination. Unsuspecting, I saw it. It was a simple express train headed in the other direction with birds forming the shape of a bird, but immediately my soul sprung into a delight I hadn’t experienced in a long time.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If God cares for the birds and the beasts, how much more does he care for us?<br />
For me?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>I am loved dearly.</strong> This is the beginning of love, that we realize we have been loved since the Beginning. Before there was time, He created me, every detail down to the number of hairs on my head. As I type this, the incredulity of it all overwhelms, bringing me to tears. I am loved. Infinitely.</p>

<p><strong>I need His love.</strong> It’s His love that makes days of hellish travel brief and momentary. It’s His love that makes early mornings after waking from a lack of sleep not bearable, but <em>beautiful</em>. It’s His love that pieces my heart back together after I’ve dragged it through the mud and shattered it violently on the rocks of my pride. I could not survive without Him.</p>

<p><strong>God provides.</strong> What God took in my original schedule, He’s giving me back bountifully in perspective and adulation of His real love. After a hard day of travel, He gives us a train that not only takes us to the next city, but stops exactly where we need to meet our host. Though I curse and complain, He softens my heart to not only type, but hold back the sweet tears of recognition.</p>

<p><strong>God is good.</strong> He does not give me the train that I so desperately wanted or the bed with my name on it. He gives me an experience that helped me to appreciate the next bed and see with clearer vision my inflexibility and my selfishness. He gave me a friend to help usher me through this process. He’s given me this life that has constantly whispered me toward maturity. All because this is goodness. I don’t understand, I can merely appreciate.</p>

<p>God loves me, fiercely. It wasn’t until I missed a train in a city I was supposed to spend no more than an hour, miles from anything recognizable that I could see this. I need this Love, as without it I am ruined. Absolutely. God provides always. He works out the situations that shouldn’t work, but in a way that trumps expectations. God is good, but He’s good in a way that surpasses understanding. I cannot understand good, but I can certainly recognize and appreciate it. It bears repeating: <strong>God loves me</strong>. <em>And I now love Him</em>.</p>

          <h2><a href="/we-missed-the-train/">we missed the train</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p><strong>We missed the train.</strong> How could we have missed it? We were sitting on the platform watching the number of minutes late our train was inch higher like a bad silent auction. But, when the train disappeared from the board (and presumably the station), we were not all aboard. That’s when it struck me finally we were on the wrong platform. We had the right number, but wrong side of the station. We were stuck in Bologna for the night, our suite on the rails chugging steadily away. That’s when I lost it. Silent meltdown. Now, several hours later, I’m on another train in Austria having taken a bus to leapfrog some track work in the foothills of the Austrian Alps.</p>

<p><strong>Lovely day ruined.</strong> We’d spent the day walking around Florence on both sides of the river, taking it all in, drinking house wine to feel like we belonged. And we did for a few minutes. We leisurely made our way to the station, boarded our train like seasoned professionals, got off and looked for where our next train would arrive an hour and a half later. It started off twenty minutes late, but quickly free fell to fifty, sixty, seventy. At eighty minutes or so late, it disappeared from the board, but we did not follow suite. In a defeated jolt of clarity, I found another track six. It had trains that were departing <em>it</em>. That was not only our accommodations, but much more that left that station last night. We found a hotel and a Plan B.</p>

<p><strong>What a day it’s been.</strong> After a refreshing four-and-a-half hours of sleep, we hurried back to the train station to book the first possible train toward our intended direction. We’d be getting there far later than hoped, but we weren’t stuck. Then, after an interesting first train and a semi-sleep filled trance that lasted the majority of our second, we were told the train was “finish. Take bus to” Munich. And we piled into a bus in some form of organized chaos and bussed to the next station through the foothills of the Austrian Alps. I feel I need to repeat this for my own gratification, but yes, that really did happen. And now, the past 24 hours begin to make sense.</p>

<p><strong>When calamity strikes.</strong> Where do I fall back on in these times? What am I relying on in the first place? Who am I that my will reigns supreme? This comedy of errors is just as growth-inducing as the deep talks that have happened over the past week and a half. In fact, it’s these moments that probably bring about more growth than any others. More importantly, God has never left me to drown. There’s always been Erik, there’s always been a way out. There was just more along the way that God had planned for me than I cared to see or experience beforehand. But, my, has the view been beautiful. Less direct for sure, this trip couldn’t have taken a better turn.</p>

<p>There you have it, the latest installment of the misadventures of the Wayward Journeyer in Europe. There’s been drama, comedy, trials, errors and triumph. All along the way, I’ve been far from alone both physically and spiritually. God all along has been reminding me of where He’s leading me through Erik and the Spirit. Sure, I get frustrated and angry, but when I quiet down, I can hear Him clear as day. What looks like a catastrophe is merely the Father gently helping His children grow into maturity. To think that I only saw that <em>we missed the train</em>.</p>

          <h2><a href="/do-you-know-where-youre-going/">do you know where you’re going?</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p><strong>Do you know where you’re going?</strong> The question strong enough to silence a lively lunch discussion, it gave us all pause as we contemplated its weight and possibility. A day later, though the conversation long over and the topic taken gingerly off the table for discussion like a cracked egg, I’m still contemplating.</p>

<p><strong>It’s all about the journey.</strong> We say this, beating it into the ground, but after a week in Europe, I’m beginning to rediscover the beauty in this cliché. If life is to be about the destination, then why do we need eighty-some years to reach it? Doesn’t that mean that the time in between birth and reaching the destination are merely lost, wasted?</p>

<p><strong>God doesn’t waste.</strong> This is just not in God’s character. There isn’t a blink of an eye or a fluttering of breeze that isn’t harkening toward His intended purpose. If God finds purpose in the creatures of the forest, then how much more so a life of His favorite creation? No, God doesn’t waste.</p>

<p><strong>Wrong turns are inevitable.</strong> We spent two days walking around London in a fog. The moment we’d gain our bearings, we’d duck inside the Tube (subway) or some tourist attraction and we were thrown for a loop. It was frustrating, but true of life. We stumbled across more things in being lost than we could have knowing every turn of the way. We ambled countless blocks in the “wrong direction”, but always getting to the desired location having experienced more.</p>

<p><strong>I know where I’m headed.</strong> What if we get lost? What if we don’t arrive at our destination? God is no less faithful. He is telling us that He has more in store for us than we’d planned. He’s telling us that His ways are higher than ours and we won’t always understand them. But, He will unfailingly get us there safely and as quickly as He needs to, no sooner.</p>

<p>Maybe the question we should be asking is “Do you know where you’re headed?” Maybe instead of telling God where we’re going, we should allow Him to tell us. Wrong turns aren’t a curse, they’re a blessing. Not reaching our destination, we haven’t failed, but God has succeeded as He always will. Rather than obsessing over where we’re going, let’s be thankful for where He’s taking us today, right now. Then again, maybe I’m crazy. <em>Do you know where you’re going?</em></p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p><strong>What do we need in life?</strong> If actions prove our hearts, then I believe most who know me would assume I need little more than the temporal comforts and satisfaction of this world. However, this doesn’t change the fact that within me craves more. My heart beats ever more desperately for that which lasts. I desire, no, I <em>need</em> the eternal. But from where?</p>

<p><strong>Nothing lasts.</strong> I think we can all agree there is nothing lasting or eternal about this earth or our existence upon it. So, from the get go I am at a bit of a loss. Like Solomon, I’ve searched and when I raised my head once more from my search, I continued my searching some more. Alas, I’m still here. Unfulfilled.</p>

<p><strong>Left wanting.</strong> Despite my search, all I’ve found is greater desperation for that which I <em>need</em>. It turns out, the things to which I turned weren’t needs, but passing fancies. The fact of the matter is that at the end of the day, none of them (drugs, lust, alcohol, etc.) were meant to fill the void I’ve become so painfully aware exists.</p>

<p><em>A pause.</em> Don’t worry, you don’t need to hide the sharp objects or keep me away from any bridges. I’m on a train, so neither of those are remotely accessible. On a serious note, stick with me for just a second and you’ll see where this is going.</p>

<p><strong>Enter Jesus.</strong> Right about the time I entered college, I finally encountered Jesus for the first real time in my life. It was an ugly encounter filled with distrust and pure rage. Only, it was returned with lovingkindness. I began to see a change in my life and there was a noticeable uptick in my life. I began to feel fuller. However, I was far from living a life “filled with the Holy Spirit.”</p>

<p><strong>God works in simple ways.</strong> There was something missing, but I’ve never been able to put my finger on what it was. People. What was missing was that deep connection with someone or someones between whom there are no secrets or mistrust. There is no deception or emotional distance. This is where God really likes to do work. I wouldn’t say this unless I felt it tangibly within me that I wake up some days feeling different from the day before.</p>

<p><strong>Be whole.</strong> God truly wants this for us, but it doesn’t magically manifest itself in our lives without work. The path to wholeness is marked with broken hearts and disappointment, but it is also not without its lion’s share of triumphs and joys. For all the heartbreak, the joy I’ve experienced has surpassed tenfold. Yes, it’s work, but it’s of the most joyous sort. Again, it cannot be done outside of relationship.</p>

<p>This is why I’ve not found it, because I was never willing to incur the valleys of heartache to reach the glorious plateaus of connection and understanding. I’ve been left wanting because of my own blindness. While God has been gently nudging me in the right direction, He wanted me to take the first step. That’s the double-edged sword of free will for you. I’ve taken it and it’s led me to a train in Europe with a friend to whom I’m inextricably tied. I won’t go into that story, but know there’s no turning back for me. What about you? Have you asked the question recently? <em>What do we need in life?</em></p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p><strong>Doors open.</strong> Suddenly, in creeps the light into the stale darkness. It dares only make a brief foray into the vacuous unknown as if to survey. Trusting it won’t be murdered by what lurks in the shadows, the light ventures further, inch by inch until the darkness is dispelled and light overtakes what once fought for obscurity. This victory proves momentary, as the door is closed in a fury and darkness overpowers the timid intruder.</p>

<p><strong>God is good.</strong> He gives us opportunities in a manner that does not torture us, but allows us to grow and appreciate those opportunities more than we could have were they immediately available to us. However, once doors are opened, He gives us a choice to trust Him and walk through or stay put. These doors don’t stay opened forever.</p>

<p><strong>Doors are fleeting.</strong> When a door is opened in life, it is but fleeting. When we see the door easing from the frame, we have the opportunity to take the door, or hesitate, allowing its time to pass and watch it closed once again.</p>

<p><strong>False doors.</strong> Of course, we run the risk of false doors. We can commit to a door before sufficiently investigating and run the risk of plunging to our proverbial death because of our haste. This isn’t my problem.</p>

<p><strong>Labor of love.</strong> My problem is a love of labor. I love to deliberate and then analyze how I deliberate until I’ve reasoned myself into a hole darker than the room in which I feel trapped and I become frantic. Yet, in my flurry of activity, I doubt even my most trusted senses and by the time I regain the sense I had, I am left cold, dark, alone.</p>

<p><strong>Was man meant to be left in such a state?</strong> I can’t imagine so. In fact, I can’t believe so. This goes back to a fundamental trust that God is good. This is truly my hangup. I get stuck on <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans%203:12&amp;version=ESV">Romans 3:12</a> where Paul says that no one is good, not even one. I impute this also to God, decontextualizing this verse and ignoring the words of Jesus in <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+10:18&amp;version=ESV">Mark 10:18</a> who says that none is good <em>but</em> God.</p>

<p>Opportunities are only available to us briefly. We have a choice to leap or stay. Whatever we choose, we need to do so knowing we diligently sought God’s wisdom in the process, but without tarrying. As for me, I’ll be walking through a door that takes me onto a plane headed for Europe for a couple weeks. Where will your door lead you? If it’s open, I pray you’ll not hesitate. If there isn’t, fear not, <em>doors open</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Do we return the favor?</strong> Are we open and caring? Do we let them get caught in our sea of forgetfulness or do we also take an active role in their lives? Do we appreciate the gift they’re giving? Do we value it as a gift straight from God?</p>

<p><strong>I miss this link.</strong> I don’t see friends always as agents of God’s plan, willing or otherwise. I forget that God can work through people close to me. For some odd reason, it’s easier to believe God works through strangers. But, when God is trying to work through those who are close to me, what is my reaction? Rarely is it one of gratitude, letting that person in with open arms to receive the present I’m being given.</p>

<p>I think we can all agree friends are a gift. Maybe you’re better at receiving them than I am. Regardless, think about it for yourself. Do you welcome people into your life? Or, do you slam the gates to your heart at the sight of a new visitor? Where can we go without others to help along the way? What kind of life is lived alone? We need the <em>people along the way</em>.</p>

          <h2><a href="/a-god-who-cant-save-you/">a god who can’t save you</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p><strong>A god who can’t save you.</strong> My dad and I were talking the other day about why people don’t question their salvation. I’d come to the conclusion that it’s just too scary a prospect. My dad, however, took it a step further asserting that once a person questions their salvation, their ultimate rescue, their entire religion comes crashing in on itself.</p>

<p><strong>Crashing in on itself.</strong> Those words sum up rather well how I feel right now. It’s not a Chicken Little sort of “the sky is falling” nonsense that I’m experiencing, either. It’s a violent earthquake of my soul where the bedrock that once seemed so well supporting the earthen desires and pursuits has been uprooted to the point of collapse. But enough about me already. How did I, how do <em>we</em> get here?</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*35j8tVPNt_G-OrzO.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><strong>God, why have you forsaken me?</strong> The answer is rather simple: because I asked Him to. Not expressly, but I have other gods around to do the heavy lifting, if you will. When I feel down, lonely, incomplete, desolate, I have my own gods to save me from these snares. Look around us, we have so many things that will save us in this world. Our jobs, friends, social status, homes, cars, vacations, etc. The list is ever-expanding, but because I, we ignore a simple fact.</p>

<p><strong>God is dead.</strong> The way we view God, the understanding and the comfort we have and the selfish convenience we have in God reduce Him to a mere god. He isn’t just the god that fits our politics, our society or even our religion. Instead, He should shape all of these. If He is who we claim Him to be, then God must inherently be bigger than all of these constructs and mainly because we need Him to be so.</p>

<p><strong>Salvation depends on it.</strong> What’s crashing down on my life isn’t God. It isn’t my faith in the loving Creator of my soul, but merely the facade of who I selfishly wanted Him to be for me. While it feels a crisis, undoubtedly I’m struggling in the fallout, these are the ashes from which the phoenix of true faith and understanding are born. Though I feel lost and cast off, I know I am near the precipice of life. All my existence has been squandered on subsistence with my fun size god, but I am no longer satisfied by this and to continue to feed my soul these empty calories, it gets costly and I get fat, complacent. No, I need salvation.</p>

<p>Where are you in all this? If you’ve crossed this bridge before, please believe I am rejoicing as I type for your life redeemed. If you have questions, leave a comment, email me (it’s on the “about” page). If you feel you’ve been forsaken as I, maybe where you want to place blame isn’t God, but your misunderstanding of Him. For those of you who absolutely cannot accept what I’ve said here, acknowledge it and take responsibility for your belief. Maybe you too want to let me know with what you have a hard time believing. I’ll be honest, I don’t think many of us Christians sit down to ask this question and fewer of us think it through. This is how we get a church who believes in God, but acts like the brazen rebels we once were.</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p><strong>Embrace change</strong>. It’s something I’m simply not comfortable with, well, not fully. Change is daunting, facing the unknown. It’s uncomfortable leaving the comfort of what is. However, change is all about. This existence is change; around us and in us, change is occurring. Change, in the violence of breaking atomic bonds and the gentle whisking away of one season giving way to the next, is occurring constantly. Change is unescapable.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Everybody has to change, or they expire.” — Donald Miller</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Refusing to change, we deny a core aspect of our existence here</strong>. From the moment we are conceived, change begins rapidly taking control over us for the next nine months. This pace is upheld throughout the first few years of our lives, but at some point I decided I was done with change. At some point, I convinced myself that a being borne of change could eventually stop. How can something so imperfect just stop changing? However, that choice isn’t entirely up to me.</p>

<p><strong>Change is a way of life</strong>. Regardless of my thoughts toward or against it, change is happening to me perpetually. There is some change over which I have control, but there is a significant portion that I simply do not. This is where we dip our feet into the pool of free will and I leave the topic at assuring you I believe in free will, but with roughly seven billion people on the planet, externalities (to borrow an economics term) are inevitable, as well as our being affected by them.</p>

<p>Even science backs me up here. Remember that law that says mass is neither created nor destroyed? Therefore, for people to be introduced into this world, there must be some matter being reappropriated to make room for this birth.</p>

<p><strong>There is only One who is unchanging</strong>. Going back to my statement of imperfection, we change because we’re imperfect. God doesn’t change, He’s the <em>only</em> who doesn’t change, because He alone is perfect. We change because no one was meant to be perfect, but perfect_able_. This is where my desire to retire from change falls short. Sure, there are the Darwinian concerns of adaptation to a changing environment, but I consider those temporal. The fact is, we were all meant to change as we were born from a rapid series of changes that slows over the course of time, but are still ever-present. To deny change is to deny the One who created life. In this way, I am Peter, the scared disciple who denied Jesus three times the night before He was arrested, cowardly and dangerously subversive. Friend, don’t let yourself follow me down this path. <em>Embrace change</em>.</p>

          <h2><a href="/family-the-man-made-island/">family: the man-made island</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>Family: just about everyone has one and everyone that does has to deal with some subset of idiosyncrasies. Being in Yellowstone last week with my mom’s side of it, at least 100 miles from anything, I’m sure all of ours were on proud display. It was a good vacation, but no family vacation is without its moments. Yes, I’m just catching onto this (I’m a late bloomer), but it wasn’t until I got back and began reflecting on the trip that the deeper truth began to hit me. I need to let go of my family.</p>

<p>The ties that bind can also be the ones that suffocate. At sixteen, I learned this the hard way. My identity had been placed solely in the one thing in the world I knew would never change, my family. I was devastatingly mistaken and with separation came ambiguity. I was no longer some_one_, but some_thing_. I’d lost my identity and realized I had no purpose. Eight years later, I’m still fighting tooth and nail to regain that identity. Eight years later, I’m just starting to learn that lesson.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“‘If anyone comes to me and does not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, yes, and even his own life, he cannot be my disciple.’” — Luke 14:26</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These are harsh words for a gentile crowd. What do they mean and why would Jesus say this? These are troublesome words even to the most devout, but they serve to help us prioritize this messy and confusing Christian life. We can only have one master, therefore one identity. Jesus is saying here that if that identity is found in family, marriage, children, then it cannot be also in Him. Likewise, if we are to identify with what we’ve done or yet to do in this life, we can have no identity in Him. Jesus was explaining that following Him meant forsaking that which is most dear to us if need be. Take it or leave it.</p>

<p>Another contradiction is brewing, I can feel it. If these aren’t the thoughts in your mind, then you have greater faith than I do. In the Ten Commandments, God commands the people to honor their father and mother. The verse in Luke does not contradict, but provides some clarity on this commandment. The clarification is that if we must choose between our parents (or family) and God, the choice is plain, but we’re still to make it in a respectful way. No contradiction whatsoever.</p>

<p>Please don’t misunderstand me here. I love my family dearly. They are very important to me and always will be. However, my family does not give me my name. My name is from the One who gave me life and breath. My name is from the One who knitted me together lovingly (Psalm 139:13). My family is amazing, but they are not my life’s ultimate purpose, nor were they ever meant to be.</p>

<p>Life is truly about priorities and mine have been askew to say the least. The family that I once called foundation, in one day was turned to firebrand setting my tenuous life aflame. Many of us fall into this snare and I am only now beginning to try and wrestle myself from it. Families are important in many ways, but they are everything in none. That place is reserved in our hearts for God. Nothing in this world can satisfy those needs the way He can and does. Trying to substitute only leads to dissatisfaction and longing. The choice is yours: strand yourself on the man-made island of family or be rescued to the rich kingdom of God.</p>

          <h2><a href="/13-mile-journey/">13 mile journey</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p><strong>13 mile journey.</strong> A couple days ago, I was set loose in the wilderness, leading a couple cousins into the beautiful, unforgiving wilderness of Yellowstone’s Black Canyon. Within a few miles, I’d begun to lead us down the wrong trail. Though running parallel to the real trail, ultimately a good sized creek stood between us and the right path.</p>

<p><strong>We had to ford the river.</strong> Though called a creek, when I’d confirmed the voice in my head that had grown to a dull roar, it was too late to do much else but cross it. Hiking all the way back would have taken up an extra 4 miles, something I didn’t feel highly possible given the magnitude of a 13 mile hike, let alone a 17 mile one.</p>

<p><strong>No shortcut.</strong> Once we’d crossed the creek (no small feat in and of itself), it was time to find the correct trail. However, it wasn’t as close to the water as I’d hoped. After being taken to the ground by a deceptively unsteady rock, the realization set in that recourse would be no easy undertaking on its own.</p>

<p><strong>Blazing a trail.</strong> I’d known where I needed to be since the moment we took the wrong turn, but at this point I realized I’d exhausted all options for a quick fix to my navigational error. It was time to buck up, ask forgiveness and stop relying on my lackadaisical desire for the easy. We began across the untraveled territory to the real trail on the horizon. My pride, shattered, but my gratefulness for my cousins’ grace and a direct path (albeit long) to the trail.</p>

<p><strong>Great day for a stroll in the woods.</strong> Though not as pristine so late in the season, we had a great day and we eventually made it to the end of the trail, and early. Sure, we tacked on a little distance as well as a ford, but we all arrived sorer and wiser for the experience. I can’t help but draw some comparisons to my journey with God.</p>

<p><strong>Never a shortcut.</strong> God gives those who choose to follow His Son the Spirit who whispers to our soul the wisdom of God. Oftentimes, we know the right path to take, but we choose otherwise. By the time we realize we should’ve listened, it’s nearly too late, but it’s still not. We ask, “If I cross this river, will you be on the other side?” and once we do so, we don’t find him. He’s not standing right there as we’d pictured and we panic. In our panic, we continue to ignore the Spirit until we exhaust all the simplest options. We settle and resign ourselves to stick it out and sooner or later, we find what we were searching for all along, along a beautiful, narrow path where we knew we belonged all along.</p>

<p>It was a trying day, but once we righted our course, it was enjoyable and absolutely breathtaking. We don’t want to listen to our gut, but this obstinance leads us into trouble. We then look for the quick fix, but with the spiritual, there is no shortcut. Once we exhaust all those options, we try the not-so-easy long way and we arrive back on the path eventually. This has been my journey with God, getting lured away by the side trails and fighting to get back to where I belong. Maybe this is your journey as well, maybe you’re on a side trail right now. It’s time to get back on track and return to the trail to which we belong. It’s long enough, we don’t need to lengthen this <em>13 mile journey</em>.</p>

          <h2><a href="/taming-the-wilderness/">taming the wilderness</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p><strong>Taming the wilderness.</strong> This post seems to be coming out a little late, but that’s only because I’m around Yellowstone with my family. It’s a beautiful place, alive with a rustic, untamed feel to the place. Coming from D.C., it’s startling the contrast between here and home. It’s foreign, but I can’t help thinking this is more of what God meant when He started creating.</p>

<p><strong>I’ve been here before.</strong> I was here four years ago, so this is not an altogether unfamiliar place, yet it is completely. Along with the immense beauty of this place, there are thick undertones of that wilderness being tamed. There are majestic beasts never meant to have to be concerned with being hit by a speeding vehicle crossing a prairie or constricted in its roaming by a wood and metal fence.</p>

<p><strong>Those animals are like my soul.</strong> My heart was never meant to be constricted and confined in the ways I allow and society encourages. I long to roam free, but not in a prairie. My heart’s prairie is the love of my God and Savior. I see peaks and I feel my depths cry out to witness the majestic peaks of God’s glory. I see rivers and I know those to be God’s cleansing blood shed on the cross. While I may physically trek to and fro on a whim, my heart is not.</p>

<p><strong>Dying inside.</strong> Everyday, every single day that I am not living freed in the love of God, my heart is dying. Perpetually, I am falling more and more into a deep slumber. Maybe this sounds metaphoric, but only because the truth of the death I feel inside is too painful to describe in detail. If physical death is excruciating, this death of my soul is a thousand times worse.</p>

<p><strong>We’re meant for life.</strong> Our hearts were only meant to feel freed when they were able to roam the never ending plains of God’s abundant love. We were meant to be free to scale the heights of His glory and dip in the refreshing waters of His forgiveness. But, to get there takes time. Only He knows the way and we have to be patient to allow Him to lead us there in His good time.</p>

<p>Roam free, my friends. You were always created to do so, but our hearts will not be content just anywhere. The world will tell us that place is success and wealth, but those only lead to discontent and death. Like the animals here, our territory of choice within the expanse of God’s love will look different as the bear chooses a different habitat generally from the bison. You have a specific purpose and place within His love, so go on and find it. Live free and quit <em>taming the wilderness</em>.</p>

          <h2><a href="/theres-been-a-tragedy-at-chick-fil-a/">there’s been a tragedy at chick-fil-a</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p><strong>There’s been a tragedy at Chick-fil-A.</strong> What’s gone on in the news concerning Chick-fil-A, I’m sure you’re more or less aware of, friends. The company gives away millions of dollars a year, but only to Christian charities who are not “gay friendly”. Then, the CEO issued statements advocating the Biblical view of the family and everyone in the LGBT community was outraged. But, the ultimate failure in this situation was yet to be seen.</p>

<p><strong>The issue isn’t money.</strong> First of all, let the company do what it wants with its money, it’s not really any business of mine how they donate. Secondly, it’s an overtly Christian company, so obviously they’re going to support their Christian worldview. On the other hand, I don’t see gay businesses supporting Christian charities, so let’s leave this one alone. On the note of worldview, it was the Christian worldview that hasn’t been upheld in this scenario, but it was by no fault of Mr. Cathy.</p>

<p><strong>One response begets another.</strong> Nearly every Chick-fil-A across the country witnessed a massive failure of the Christian worldview August 1. Instead of loving our neighbors, we, the Christian community, flocked to our chicken. We showed love to a corporation, not people. We showed that we are more concerned with our own than reaching those who feel rightly blighted by the Church. In essence, we showed hate to people who need probably most to see love right now. Fail.</p>

<p><strong>Supporting a brother.</strong> Sure, we were trying to show support for a man of the faith who was under attack. There are ways to do that without spurning or spiting the other side. Besides, it’s not Chick-fil-A who’s on the stand, it’s God. Really, it’s the Christian faith which people do not trust and given a great opportunity on the national stage, we gave those who needed reassurance more cannon fodder. We accomplished nothing than to push the LGBT community even further away, and forcefully.</p>

<p>So friends, what do we do? We’ve kicked the dog and expect it to come running back to us. It doesn’t work that way, especially when in the same breath we claim to uphold loving all. These are people we’re dealing with; people who need love just as much as we all do. If we’re going to support Christian businesses and morals, then we have to do so in a Christian way, which is loving our neighbor, <em>all</em> of them. It doesn’t matter how you start, but let’s start now. It’s time to act, because <em>there’s been a tragedy at Chick-fil-A</em>.</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p><strong>Make a difference.</strong> I’ve gone around for most of my life feeling misunderstood by the people around me. “If they’d only take the time,” I thought, “then they’d get to know me for who I really am,” all the while never letting them in to my world. See, the fact is I’m scared. I’m terrified of letting people in and allowing them a chance to hurt me unlike any other.</p>

<p><strong>Not your hero.</strong> What makes heroes great, what we love most about them is they risk who they are for those they love or what they believe in. Between my parents’ separation and a breakup a couple years later of the relationship I used to run from my family situation in shambles, my tendency of closing off turned full-blown defense mechanism. I didn’t become the hero I so desperately longed and still long to be, but the antithesis of one.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Do you not know that in a race all the runners run, but only one gets the prize? Run in such a way as to get the prize.” I Corinthians 9:24</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>We’re meant to be heroes.</strong> No, I’m not saying you should run around with a mask and cape always at the ready. However, I’m saying we should all be ready to risk who we are for what matters most to us. In other words, we were made to pursue our callings with everything we’ve got.</p>

<p><strong>Running scared.</strong> The fact is, nearly all of us don’t. Plain and simple. However, the “why” is more interesting. Sadly, many people don’t understand their calling, because they don’t take the time to fully appreciate who God’s made them to be. Friends, I’d consider that an identity crisis. Also, many people are just too afraid that their purpose isn’t important, practical or safe. To answer those quickly, false, good and excellent. Allow me to explain.</p>

<p><strong>Calling is important.</strong> If you believe yourself created in every way by God, then it follows that He’s created you uniquely (just look around). Now, if you’ve been created uniquely, then God’s omniscience means that must be for a well-thought reason. That reason is your purpose. If you believe all the previous, then you cannot believe God to create some for greater purposes than others. That’s just not how He works.</p>

<p><strong>Practical is a construct.</strong> What was practical yesterday doesn’t follow necessarily tomorrow. Practical is such a fluid term. On it’s own, it carries no meaning. Practical is defined by its context, not a strict definition. If this is practical, then why do we use it as a metric for our life’s purpose? When deciding to send Jesus to earth, do you think God asked if His idea was practical?</p>

<p><strong>No movie will be made about safe.</strong> Our goal isn’t to be movie stars or the inspiration for the next great film epic, but look at this. We love movies because they mimic real life in some way. There has not been a movie about someone being safe throughout and conquering anything. If we are living safe lives, then we are stymying ourselves in the quicksand of mediocrity. We can only live a life of unfulfillment. Every story involves risk and by virtue of this fact alone, we cannot lead safe lives.</p>

<p>What are you waiting for? Why do you insist on keeping the world waiting on you? The world doesn’t care if you don’t start out doing it well, because no one does. What matters is your getting out there and trying it. We’ve all screwed up massively in one way or another. It’s expected. What’s not expected is that you’ll stick with it long enough, love hard enough, to make a difference.Go ahead. I dare you to <em>make a difference</em>.</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p><strong>Comfortably numb.</strong> I’d spent nearly eight years in a well-crafted cocoon. No, I’m not waiting metamorphosis, but a little over eight years ago, the comfortable life as I’d come to know it came crashing on my head. My parents were separating, but moreover, my identity was gone. It was on that very day that I began insulating myself against the nor’easters of this world. It wasn’t until an uncomfortable, hot ride in the steel cage known as the backseat of a police cruiser that I had any inkling I’ve been missing out all these years. See, rather than moving on and pressing forward, I’d been spinning my wheels, finding a place where I could dull away and forget what troubled me, but I could be afforded this luxury no longer.</p>

<p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruOFEvqazGo]</p>

<p><strong>Paradise lost.</strong> Eight years ago, I first turned to alcohol, then dabbled in pot. I didn’t know where else to turn, because God didn’t let bad things happen to good people, people couldn’t be trusted and I had never been prepared for that kind of pain. What’s a boy to do in this situation? I dulled the pain each weekend along with a few other senses, but I made sure to keep up the appearances of performance at school and on the soccer field.</p>

<p><strong>Only a fool repeats his folly.</strong> You’d think that in eight years I’d have had enough wakeup calls and warnings to get with the program, but most of you don’t know how hardheaded I am. As with any unhealthy habit, I’d had plenty, even given up pot at the drop of a hat a few years ago, but alcohol was a much more enticing anodyne. Not only did it soothe away pain, but it can provide for a great social scene (just go to your favorite local watering hole).</p>

<p><strong>In the company of strangers.</strong> One of the catch-22s of alcohol is it makes you friends with complete strangers. No, I don’t mean other people, but yourself when you get comfortable staring at the person in the mirror whom you’ve never taken the time or inconvenience to know on any level. After that period of time, nothing is familiar and the question of “Who am I?” only gets more daunting by the day.</p>

<p><strong>Paradise found.</strong> There’s still much to deal with in the aftermath, but that car ride in the cruiser and the following night of joy in a cell was God’s grace in grand form. No one was hurt, no one dead, but my soul lurched to a start. It was the necessary wakeup call, painful as it has been, but nothing short of what I needed. Sure, I’m ashamed it came to this, but there’s much yet to come of it and for that I’m excited. Now, it’s time for me to move on and bring others through this with me. It’s time to bear my soul through the ice and fire of this world. I now know that if God is for me (and He must be), then who can be against?</p>

<p>Friend, how are you attempting to dull the pains of this life? Is it focusing on other people’s lives? Is it acts of service or even ministry? Take a good, hard look and answer that for yourself. No, there’s not a moment to spare. You can’t get it back and no one’s ever guaranteed the next moment. I’ve wasted enough for the lot of us. You have a promise, you have a purpose, now go and live them. The world is thirsting for you to fulfill your potential. Today’s the day we break free from our chains together and tell the world we’re no longer happy as the undead, living <em>comfortably numb</em>.</p>

            <p><strong>Gifts of the Spirit.</strong> So, there I was sitting in front of a table full of adults leading a discussion on the Holy Spirit. I was teaching them on the gifts of the Spirit, a 23-year-old teaching a group over twice his age and they were hearing about these gifts as if for the first time. It was then I realized what an unknown quantity we like to maintain in the ghost-like member of the Trinity.</p>

<p><strong>We don’t like ghosts.</strong> I think we get nervous trying to tell people about a being that is ever-present, always working, but totally invisible. It’s hard to get into depth about the only member of the Trinity not covered in detail in the Bible. Therefore, we shy away from teaching about gifts from this mystical component to God. However, as a Christian, we are granted His presence in our lives for the duration. Given the amount of contact we have with this being, it’s imperative we understand Him a little better through His gifts.</p>

<p><strong>Take a few minutes.</strong> Read through that list, Christians, and see if any of those fit you. Then, go ask those closest to you to tell you which <em>they</em> see in you. Don’t worry, this post will still be here when you get back.</p>

<p><strong>Use it!</strong> You’ve been given so that you can use your gifting to give to others. If we’re not utilizing our gifts in a way intended (this means with forethought intention) to glorify and serve God, then we’re wasting our gifts. If the first time you try goes poorly, remember that your gifts, like any other skill or ability take time to cultivate. Just because you’ve been given a gift from the Holy Spirit doesn’t make you Superman or mean you’ll know how to use it. Let it be awkward and clunky at first. There’s learning that needs to take place in the process.</p>

<p>There’s a lot of mystery surrounding the Holy Spirit. I ask you to reconcile yourself to that fact and grow comfortable leaving a little room for mystery here. We first must come to terms with the fact that He has given each of us a set of gifts and it’s up to us to discover what they are, use them and cultivate them in our lives. Otherwise, we’re wasting a precious gift from God. The world can’t wait any longer. Today, we all need to begin serving God (better for some, for the first time for others) with our <em>gifts of the Spirit</em>.</p>

            <p><strong>Live experiences.</strong> I’m sometimes crippled by my clunky pursuit of living a full and meaningful life. I get bogged down in searching for meaning in most everything I do. Somewhere along the line, I began to equate meaning with growing older and inherently wiser, thus being able to lead a more important life. So, I equated age with impact. This was until my dad’s friend issued these words at the dinner table, “Live experiences, not years.” I’m still trying to clear the rubble from that bomb.</p>

<p><strong>Which are you?</strong> Are you, like me, trying to live as long as possible, playing it safe and hoping to get as much time here as you can? Are you clinging onto the past, wishing it hadn’t gotten away from you so quickly? Does the word risk come pre-packaged with the word “calculated” in front, or does it unsettle you altogether? Or, are you truly enjoying the ride? Are you not living <em>for</em> the moment, but <em>in</em> the moment, enjoying the grace of every given moment? Maybe that’s the real question. Do you see every moment, every situation, every person in your life as an instance of grace? Only living in grace can we allow the years to go as they may, but fully <em>live experiences</em>.</p>

We’re all searching for love in this world, but did we know all along it was You?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Searching high and low.</strong> I stand before you today guilty of the very thing about which I protest. I’ve spent too much time searching desperately for a love to sweep me off my feet and carry me wistfully into the sunset. I’ve sought girls and bottles, bongs and other things, but have been left as empty as the bottle the morning after. I’ve searched high and low, but don’t feel much closer than when I started.</p>

<p><strong>I’m not the only one.</strong> Just a quick glance online or at the people around you will show I’m not alone. I’m not the only one who bought into the fairy tale ending. I’m certainly not the only one frustrated I can’t find it. Just ask the thousands who are members of two or more dating sites. The search is maddening.</p>

<p><strong>Looking in all the wrong places.</strong> People can only love you so much or for so long. That’s the fact of a finite being. As such, even my parents, amazing as can be, cannot love me enough to quench this need. No, there is not a human being who can fulfill this desire of my heart. Not a thing on this earth can quell the cries of my soul.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I lift up my eyes to the hills. From where does my help come? My help comes from the Lord, who made heaven and earth.” — Psalm 121:1–2</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>I’ve found the One.</strong> Downcast and brokenhearted, my search has led me here. There is only one who can love me deep as I need. Only one can love me every second of every minute of my life. I’ve found the One for whom my soul pants. Exotic, yes, this love is, but it is far from new. It’s the first love I ever knew, but I’m able to look at it with new eyes. Returning home from my wayward rebellion, I’m greeted by a Father overjoyed at the return of His lost son. Though I left Him, He’s waited patiently, grieving everyday until my return. And now that I’ve returned, there are no “I told you so”s, but only celebration and love. Love, true love, has always been right here.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“In this is love, not that we have loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.” — 1 John 4:10</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We all are allured by the shiny and new. It’s easy to lose sight of the things that have lost their shine. We’re all looking in our own ways for the One, the love in our lives to trump all others. We spend our lives searching for the Hollywood ending only to find ourselves alone and with that much less time. Inevitably, people, everyone, will let us down. However, God cannot as He is both infinite and perfect. He will not meet our expectations, but only because His are so much greater than our own. Sure you can search all your life, but only here will you find your Love. Friends, there is an end to this endless quest <em>looking for love</em>.</p>

          <h2><a href="/calamity-is-a-blessing/">calamity is a blessing</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p><strong>Calamity is a blessing.</strong> It’s easy to see that God is raining down His love on us when He gives us what we want. It’s not hard to appreciate the moments when our desires are met directly. However, God being vast as He is, is certainly not limited to this kind of provision in His giving. In fact, that He is willing to give us what we think we absolutely <em>don’t</em> want speaks volumes more about His love than the former.</p>

<p><strong>Granting wishes is simple.</strong> Not that it’s easy, but for God to give us every desire we thrust before Him in prayer would be all too easy. If He worked this way, all He’d need is a pad to keep track of our desires and then to snap His fingers every once in a while to manifest the desired blessings. As nice as this sounds, I almost fell asleep typing that. To boil God down to a cosmic ATM is to strip Him of all infinite nature.</p>

<p><strong>Why would I ask for what I don’t want?</strong> That’s not quite the point here. God gives us His best. That is also for <em>our</em> best, but we don’t have the ability to see that best most of the time. Whether we see or acknowledge it is inconsequential. The fact remains, it is <em>the</em> best. Really, it is up to us to let Him reveal the blessing to us in due time.</p>

<p><strong>We avoid pain.</strong> This is primarily why we don’t see God’s gifts as such. Oftentimes, He opts to value our well being above our comfort, which involves a certain amount of pain. This sounds cruel on the surface, but does it not take more love to give a child what it needs over what it says it wants? As the ultimate Father, God is able to see clearly what we need and through that knowledge, shields us from the blessings that would only hurt us and only grants us that which mature His children.</p>

<p><strong>God can never be an ATM.</strong> For God to simply grant our wishes like an ATM or a genie, well He would be just that. Powerful, maybe, but ultimately subservient to a programmer or the holder of the lamp. For God to have simply been in the beginning and created from before time and space, He cannot be anything less than all powerful. Therefore, God must have the ability to grant desires as He sees most beneficial, otherwise He is not even a god.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“‘What father among you, if his son asks for a fish, will instead of a fish give him a serpent; or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion? If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will the heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!’” — Luke 11:11–13</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We cannot box in the God of the universe with our conception of pleasure. We have to accept that blessings, like their Giver, are beyond our comprehension. He is not here to sate our happiness. He is the perfect Father, knowing perfectly well what His children need and want. He does want to grant us every request, but in His omniscience, He knows certain requests will bring us only harm. Children, let’s let Him love on us the only way a perfect God can, perfectly and start to see that <em>calamity is a blessing</em>.</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p><strong>Zombies and purpose.</strong> What do zombies and purpose have in common? Much. Especially when we’re talking about preparing for the zombie apocalypse. For those of you in disbelief about zombies, hold onto that and maybe forget the zombies, but keep the apocalypse. If we’re to get ready for this brain-munching finale, we don’t have much time and we have everything to lose. So, where do we start in getting prepared?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Do you not know that in a race all the runners run, but only one receives the prize? So run that you may obtain it. Every athlete exercises self-control in all things. They do it to receive a perishable wreath, but we an imperishable. So I do not run aimlessly; I do not box as one beating the air. But I discipline my body and keep it under control, lest after preaching to others I myself should be disqualified.” — I Corinthians 9:24–27</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Establish a goal.</strong> Without a goal, you have no way of measuring how close you are to achieving that. Also, if your goal is too lofty or vague, then you have no way of achieving it and evaluation once again is out the door. So, pick something defined and achievable.</p>

<p><strong>Be disciplined.</strong> You’ve got survival to train for and no one’s going to do it for you. If you want it, you have to put in the work to get it. Then again, if you really want it, you’re probably out there working toward it now. Do it. What’s the holdup?</p>

<p><strong>Find a training partner.</strong> Maybe two or three, but find people to help you achieve your goal and make you accountable to that end. Sure, you <em>could</em> do it on your own, but training works best with someone else there to help push you forward.</p>

<p><strong>It’s not about you.</strong> You have to help your training partner as well. You can’t just ignore their survival in the training process, otherwise they won’t stick around. No, you have to help them along the way as well. You’re in it together, remember that fact.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“And he humbled you and let you hunger and fed you with manna, which you did not know, nor did your fathers know, that he might make you know that man does not live by bread alone, but man lives by every word that comes from the mouth of the Lord.” — Deuternomy 8:3</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Get your head straight.</strong> In those last days, when all you see around you are mindless corpses, what will you have to hold onto? What is keeping you through till the end? If we are not also training and fortifying our minds with ultimate truth, then we are dooming ourselves now.</p>

<p><strong>Pray hard.</strong> Similarly to the mind, we must also have a ledge to cling onto for our souls in the end. Our innermost part must have a foothold, otherwise it’s destined to go crashing down the rock face taking us along with it. Therefore, we must keep it in contact with the only One who can sustain a soul throughout eternity. We don’t know how long those final days will last, but we have to be prepared to endure.</p>

<p>We’ve been in the last days for some time now and I see people all around growing weary of waiting. We are lulled into a slumber as if those days in which we’re living are never going to come. They’re here. We’re living them now. I talk about zombie apocalypse, but these steps, these points are for any apocalypse, including that micrp-apocalypse we casually call death. If we are not preparing ourselves daily for that, then we will not make it. If we are not mind, body and soul prepared for these last days, we have doomed ourselves to die. Friends, that’s a gruesome death. None of us wants that. So, let’s get training.</p>

          <h2><a href="/find-your-purpose/">find your purpose</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p><strong>Find your purpose.</strong> Yeah, just go out and do it. What are you waiting for? Go and live out your purpose! I think this summarizes what many of us went through post college graduation. We took a few classes on a subject and once you’ve been pushed out the door, that field is your purpose and you’re to hit the ground running.</p>

<p><strong>Purpose isn’t arbitrary.</strong> There is nothing about purpose that’s pulled out of a hat. I don’t know how you picked your major, but the way I did was far from scientifically. Instead, purpose is based on who we are intrinsically, what we care about and how we interact with the world around us.</p>

<p><strong>I am what I am, but who is that?</strong> Think about your personality. What kind of person are you? Do you enjoy groups or solitude? Do you prefer spontaneity or structure? Are you rational or an idealist? Based on our personality, we begin to get an understanding of how we’re wired and where that could be best utilized.</p>

<p><strong>What are your passions?</strong> Find the things about which you’re naturally interested. Whether it’s clean water, technology, orphans, teenagers, sex trafficking, etc., don’t worry about how ridiculous you think it may be. The fact is, we’re all different in what matters most to us. That’s how it’s supposed to be.</p>

<p><strong>Communication is key.</strong> Once we’ve found something about which we’re passionate, we have to find a role within the passion that fits us. For instance, someone who is well-spoken and likes people would make a better salesperson than someone more introverted. A rational thinker comfortable with solitude might make a better programmer than someone more extroverted. You wouldn’t use a screw driver for a spoon, so why would you settle for a role that doesn’t best utilize how you are?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“So I became great and surpassed all who were before me in Jerusalem. Also my wisdom remained with me. And whatever my eyes desired I did not keep from them. I kept my heart from no pleasure, for my heart found pleasure in all my toil, and this was my reward for all my toil. Then I considered all that my hands had done and the toil I had expended in doing it, and behold, all was vanity and a striving after wind, and there was nothing to be gained under the sun.” — Ecclesiastes 2:9–11</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Purpose is given purpose.</strong> Just because we’re passionate about something doesn’t make our work purposeful. True purpose is derived from the reason for which we strive. If we are striving for any reason less than God, all our work is in vain. There is nothing on this earth that will not pass away. Thus, all we do devoted to things of the earth, be they success, ourselves, security, fulfillment, will fade away in due time. There is One and Him alone that will never fade.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Passion is consuming. It’s tinged with discontent, restlessness, and determination that propel someone to action.” — Marc Estes</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Purpose is consistent with who we are. Ultimately, our purpose stems from God and who He has made us to be. He gave us each a specific personality that deals with situations and people in different ways. We cannot be passionate about everything, but we must be faithful to the people and issues that matter most to us. In doing so, we also need to be wise in the role we take on caring about those things. Caring about anything in a capacity that is not consistent with who we are is still not maximizing our gifts and potential. So today, if you haven’t already, start asking some questions and go <em>find your purpose</em>.</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p><strong>Purpose starts with understanding.</strong> We all want to lead purposeful lives. No one wants to lead a dull existence that lacks direction or significance. Without understanding who we are, it’s impossible to see fully our potential for what we could be.</p>

<p><strong>You wouldn’t use a screwdriver as a spoon.</strong> While we understand that different tools and instruments have different uses, we don’t seem to apply this to people, especially not ourselves. The fact is, we are all created to fulfill a specific role. Those roles have much to do with the personalities and experiences we’ve been given. We are who we are to make that role easier, not harder to fulfill.</p>

<p><strong>A body has many parts.</strong> For the world, the Church to function, it takes many people fulfilling different roles working together. Otherwise, critical tasks don’t get accomplished and the entire system breaks down. If everyone decided to be a doctor or a lawyer, we’d all starve and die because no one was there to grow food. Likewise, in the Church, people begin to suffer spiritually when there aren’t people to take care of the less glamorous roles (in our eyes).</p>

<p><strong>Working in harmony.</strong> The beauty in this points toward the person of God. God is three working together like this in perfect, seamless harmony. The Father, Son and Holy Spirit each fills a different role without overlap, but there is nothing that falls between the gaps of division of labor. In this image, God created man to work together to this end.</p>

<p>We long for purpose in life, but first, we have to understand the nature and design of purpose. We were created meticulously to fulfill a purpose that no one else can. However, we cannot simply succeed on our own. We are but a part in the greater puzzle that is our society. Without one, the puzzle is not complete. Together, we form a beautiful picture of the Maker on display for all to see. Take the time today to probe what your purpose is. Ask expectantly and you won’t be disappointed, because <em>purpose starts with understanding</em>.</p>

          <h2><a href="/who-i-am-when-im-alone/">who i am when i’m alone</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p><strong>Who I am when I’m alone?</strong> It’s a question in need of asking and often. However, it’s not a question of who I am when it is me, myself and I, but a question of who I am when I am alone with God. The question may be best stated as, “Who was I made to be?” and I found myself asking that this weekend.</p>

<p><strong>Adding to the noise.</strong> It’s easy to go on day after day, following the yellow brick road. It’s simple to just accept the societal definition of success and carry on blissfully down that path. At some point, I realized it’ll never end. I’m just now realizing I’ll never arrive at Oz. Sure, I may be a lion, but I’ve got no courage and what good is that?</p>

<p><strong>A lion with no courage.</strong> I’m lost. What’s a lion without any courage? Well, it’s just a large house cat, but that’s not what it was created to be. Likewise, I’m not who I was created to be. I’m not following a path that leads me to the true form of myself. I’m not following a road that’ll eventually lead me home.</p>

<p><strong>Arriving at who I am.</strong> I’m sure you’re asking at what I’m thinking I’m arriving. This is a great question and the answer is this: I’m arriving at a place where my soul’s delight is the delight of my Lord. I’m arriving at a place of harmony of wills. I’m arriving at Eden. However, it’ll take a lifetime to get there and I’m OK with that fact.</p>

<p><strong>Who is the true self?</strong> Simply, it is the lion leading the life of a lion. In my case, it is a life devoted to leveraging my strengths, using my natural weaknesses, to rely on God to use me to light the world on fire around me with the torch of love. The true self is the version of me God created, unadulterated, to have the greatest impact on this world in need of love.</p>

<p><strong>Where’s the path?</strong> This is the question that comes after the great decision to seek the true self. As people look different, so do our paths to arrive at ourselves, but I know mine runs straight to my Savior. The path looks ordinary, like the one Robert Frost wrote of many years ago. It seems ordinary and unused, but it is far from ordinary. Less glamorous, this road leads to life and life everlasting, but only for those willing to spend a life traveling it. My path just feels natural and it’s been right beside me all along.</p>

<p><strong>How do I know I’m on the way?</strong> There’s a feeling deeper than the senses. There’s a calm, but there’s also a great anticipation rising up as well. It’s like I’m a child once more on the way to grandma’s house. I cannot wait to arrive, but I’m certain the road I’m on will get me there. Essentially, it’s a faith informed by the reinforcement of the soul. Where my soul finds God, I cannot help but rejoice that He is near and I am nearing Him.</p>

<p>It doesn’t make sense, this decision. It’s not normal or fundamentally sound, but by what standards? Society works in a way that emphasizes some, but shuns other personalities. However, if we are not free to be ourselves, then what good is a life; what good is being born? If I am not living my own life, then why is it that <em>I</em> am living and not that someone else in my shoes? The world needs you just as much as it needs me and no one can deliver that but you and me, respectively. Rather than deny the world as well as ourselves, let’s make the decision today to take the path untraveled. Let’s step closer to our true selves and pick up those torches of love. Whether you’re with me or not, I need to find out <em>who I am when I’m alone</em>.</p>

          <h2><a href="/free-is-costly/">free is costly</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p><strong>Free is costly.</strong> There’s an aspect of my faith that I realized as I was finishing up <em>Prodigal God</em> by Tim Keller that I grossly misunderstand on a daily basis. That is the matter of grace and the disillusionment I have with its affiliation to free. See, grace is given freely to all who will accept and so in my head, grace must not cost. However, what I’ve come to realize is that free is not the extreme of cheap, that grace is not cheap.</p>

<p><strong>What is grace?</strong> Without delving too deep, it is a gift whose recipient is undeserving. The giver expects nothing in return and the receiver has not done something to merit and so must choose to accept the gift. The giver gives for the sake of giving and it is not an exchange, but a unidirectional act of kindness.</p>

<p><strong>What is free?</strong> Free is without charge. It means to give away without asking anything in return. Free is as cheap as it gets. Free is the cheapest of the cheap. It has so little a cost, that cost is represented by the number 0.</p>

<p><strong>How did grace become free?</strong> I think we all know that nothing is free. Everything costs, whether it’s time, effort, materials, money, goods, services. For grace to become free, God had to give up His only Son and sacrifice Him. The penalty for sin, treason against God, is death and the only way that could be paid for was Jesus. See, a person could not give up their own life and be forgiven as they’d already died in the first part of the transaction and could not themselves be saved.</p>

<p><strong>Grace is costly.</strong> God paid the price of His Son’s life so that grace could be free for us. That is a huge price to pay. God gave up the most valuable thing He had, so that we could receive this gift. Likewise, grace requires the giver to accept the consequences of others and give them better than they have earned or could earn on their own. Grace becomes free because the giver has paid the gift’s price.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Grace is God giving up His most valuable possession, His Son, so that we could be reconciled to Him and everyday Him continuing to give still more.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Grace has implications.</strong> First and foremost, grace means that we are priceless to God. God went through the painstaking effort not to sacrifice Himself, but even His only Son. There is no greater love than this. Secondly, grace, while appearing free, is far from cheap. Showing grace to others means paying the cost ourselves as the givers and this sometimes hurts. Finally, grace dictates that all are valuable, as the Giver gave so much and yet He continues to give, the Gift that was enough for everyone, ourselves who were deemed recipients of such a gift and those around us who were deemed likewise.</p>

<p>I think most of us understand the terms free and grace. However, putting the two together creates a disconnect from the reality, cheapening grace as an unwanted good that could not sell. Grace is free to the recipient, but expensive to the giver. The key is that the gift is not merited by the recipient, but lavished by the giver. We are all just as undeserving as the next person, but will we today choose to give the gift of grace knowing full well that <em>free is costly</em>?</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p><strong>Too far gone.</strong> The scariest task we can undertake in this life is to peel back the layers of the persona we’ve carefully put together for ourselves and be simply who we are. Even scarier still, allowing a perfect God to see that person. However, in this day of privacy settings and social media, we’ve gotten so used to manipulating the information available about ourselves that we begin to do this very same PR work with God as well. While you may fool some people for a while, God is not fooled for an instant.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“‘Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, and before you were born I consecrated you; I appointed you a prophet to the nations.’” — Jeremiah 1:5</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“For you formed my inward parts; you knitted me together in my mother’s womb.” — Psalm 139:13</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>God made you.</strong> Before the creation of the earth, He created you and knew every inch of you inside and out. If He knew you before time, then how much could you surprise Him with now? Don’t deceive yourself, you are no mystery before God. However, just as you were loved then, you are loved now.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“‘Can a man hide himself in secret places so that I cannot see him? declares the LORD. Do I not fill heaven and earth? declares the LORD.’” Jeremiah 23:24</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>God is everywhere.</strong> There isn’t a thing you have done or can do that God Himself did not witness. Nothing you can do can take that less than sterling remark or event off your timeline. No, He’s been there through it all. He’s seen everything. He hasn’t been idle, either. Throughout each twist and turn of life, He’s been trying to subtly let you know He’s there.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“And the son said to him, ‘Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son.’ But the father said to his servants, ‘Bring quickly the best robe, and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet. And bring the fattened calf and kill it, and let us eat and celebrate. For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found.’ And they began to celebrate.” — Luke 15:21–24</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>He’s waiting with open arms.</strong> Everything that we try to hide from others, all that we find unsavory and unlovable is not so to God. He is waiting for us expectantly to turn around and see His outstretched arms. He is openly inviting us back into His presence. He’s offering us a feast, the magnitude of which has never been seen before.</p>

<p>What is it you’ve done that cannot be forgiven? Where have you gone that you can’t return? There are no deeds too foul and no place too far. You are loved by a God who gave everything He had for you and wants to keep giving you more. So you’ve run, you’ve sinned, you don’t know how to say sorry. This isn’t about you. None of this is about you, but in fact it’s about Him, who <em>He</em> is and what <em>He</em>’s done. Who else has done this for you? How many could endure such hardship in relationship and still welcome you with open arms? Won’t you simply fall into them today? No one is <em>too far gone</em>.</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p><strong>Constructive dissent.</strong> You know, it’s not a sin to disagree with a church. I think you’ll find much of Jesus’ ministry aimed at taking issue with the Church in His day. Instead, it is our reaction to that dissenting view and how we choose to express it that may be sinful. To the Christian and the non-Christian, how do/have we presented our view?</p>

<p><strong>The church is flawed.</strong> Both your local and the global churches are deeply flawed. Why? Because each is comprised of several messed up and imperfect people. Together, these people are trying to lead others, work out their own and walk together with some in their exploration of faith. This is the deepest, most sensitive part of a man and when you have several people pursuing this sort of exploration in close proximity, things are bound to get messy. And they have for many, many years. This is the way the Church has always been and must be until the return of Jesus.</p>

<p><strong>Our response doesn’t have to be.</strong> Any idiot can fling mud in the face of another. A monkey can fling poop at just about anything. However, it takes a person of fortitude to stick around and help enact change. It takes a real person to explain to others, listen and come to an understanding.</p>

<p>The choice is ours. We can sit around grumbling, mocking, etc. Or, we can become the solution. We sit around waiting for others to do their jobs or we can do our own. Whether you are a churchgoer or not, this question is for us all. When we disagree, do we simply tear down or do we offer <em>constructive dissent</em>?</p>

          <h2><a href="/dealing-with-our-pain/">dealing with our pain</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p><strong>Dealing with our pain.</strong> Imagine you’re reaching up onto your cabinets (because you can reach the top of them on your tiptoes) and you suddenly feel a pain shooting through your middle. You shrug it off as a pulled muscle or a tweak and carry on with your life. The next day, as you’ve felt this pain continuously, you finally decide to seek some an outside opinion and that person tells you to go see the doctor. You do and they confirm your suspicions that you have a hernia. The surgery is setup and as you’re driving to the hospital that morning, you lose it and give into the probability that the surgery will probably cause more pain than you’re experiencing currently. You don’t want to go through with it. I can deal with the pain I have, I don’t want to take on anymore than I have to.</p>

<p><strong>Now, imagine this pain to be emotional.</strong> I know I’m talking about my recent hernia, but the thing about pain is we avoid them all similarly. So, think of a past hurt, something that was rather scarring growing up and you tell me. Have you dealt with it? Do you want to? Were you even aware that you’re still hurting and affected by it today, years down the line? I’m going to go out on a limb and assume “no” to each. Friend, whether you see it or not, this is a major problem today. This is an even more evident problem in the Church and we need to begin fixing it now.</p>

<p><strong>Not all pain is the same.</strong> This is the first thing we need to understand about pain. There are unnecessary pains in life we incur in our lives and they bring us only hurt. We learn from those and we avoid them, yes. However, there are also pains that invite both hurt and growth into our lives. These are good pains and while they hurt, there is a reward at the end and we are better for it.</p>

<p><strong>We need pain.</strong> I’m not advocating that life should be a cesspool of pain, but pain is a necessary experience in this life. First of all, we’re stubborn (well, <strong>I</strong> am) and sometimes we need a stronger reminder of God’s presence in our lives. There are just times when we get so wrapped up in our own microcosms, we need to be rudely (for lack of a better word) awakened to the reality around us. Second of all, if life were gumdrops and unicorns, well I can only take so many unicorns. No, if life were easy, then how much fun would that be? I don’t know about you, but I’d get bored and fast. Finally, we need pain as it highlights what is seriously important. As we’re looking back through our lives, pain is like the highlighted sections of the book where we look and see the biggest events in our lives.</p>

<p><strong>Pain is daunting.</strong> Yes, pain <em>hurts</em>. That’s the fact of the matter, but we have to understand as I did in the car the other morning was that the discomfort we face in the dealing with that pain is far less than the aggregate and the potential of not facing it. While dealing with pain may lead to an intense hurt, that pales in comparison to a lifetime filled with a slightly lesser (maybe) pain we’ll undoubtedly carry with us.</p>

<p>The choice is ours. We can choose to live with the pain to which we’ve already resigned ourselves, sure. However, we can also go through the wall, confronting that pain and all that’s wrapped up in it. We can suffer for the rest of our lives watching as our souls gangrene over the rest of our lives, dying before our very eyes. We can live never truly alive, constantly dying inside because we chose to settle with the pain that is lesser today. Or, we can see the Doctor today and begin <em>dealing with our pain</em>.</p>

          <h2><a href="/control-freaks/">control freaks</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p><strong>Control freaks.</strong> We all seek to control our circumstances in one way or another. When my parents separated, I became the “responsible” older brother. I panicked inside, so my response was to control what I could by clamping down on everything around me. By night, I acted out more openly through partying. I attempted to control my pain by looking for happiness at the bottom of the bottle, in another’s eyes. It was at the core a rebellion against God aimed at my taking control from the one who had obviously failed me.</p>

<p><strong>I’m still that older brother.</strong> In fact many Christians I know are, but more so when it comes to our faith. I often do “good” in order to turn around and hit up the cosmic ATM, getting good out. This cosmic ATM is how I view God all too often. I feel that because I have done x amount of good, I should expect x amount back with interest. This isn’t faith or even a religion, but slavery. It is a slavery to the gifts of God. To a God who says His thoughts and ways are higher than ours, this approach only leads to bitterness and disappointment.</p>

<p><strong>I am sorry.</strong> For those of you who have gotten an air or the very brunt of bitterness and disappointment, I could not be more sorry. I want you to know that here and now. For those of you who have received it from other Christians, I am just as sorry. God never meant for a faith like this. Jesus never wanted followers like that. If you’ve felt looked down upon, marginalized or in any other way mistreated or abused by the Church, I’m sorry. It’s not enough, but words do not express my feelings here.</p>

<p><strong>Lost.</strong> Read the <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%2015:11-32&amp;version=ESV">Prodigal Son</a> and you’ll see (without going too deep into this story) that both brothers are in fact “lost” or missing the point. What is harder to see is that the story ends with the pious older bother not returning to the father. This fact is often overlooked as Jesus was probably telling the story to show the religiously devout that their blindness, their “lostness”, was far more dangerous than that of the younger brother. Two thousand years later, I fear we’ve not heard this message.</p>

<p><strong>Found.</strong> You’ll note the younger brother returns to his father’s abundant grace and is thrown a massive party (probably the biggest the father ever threw). While the younger brother told the father he was dead in his eyes, the younger son was forgiven and his transgression forgotten. If you at all identify with this brother, this story goes to show there is more than hope for you in God’s eyes. You may be wayward as I know I have been, but there is a way back. At the end of that road, there is the Father waiting anxiously to run to you (unbefitting of a propertied man), hugging you joyously, giving you his own clothes and throwing you a great feast. He’s been waiting for you. Come home.</p>

<p>Despite what we’ve been told, all are lost. We’re all looking for ways to control the world around us. We’ve all been affected by people trying to control us in that effort. In the end, we need to realize that we alone cannot control such a complex world and we need some help. He’s been waiting. For the older brother and the younger, He’s desperately awaiting your return. For what are we waiting? Why can’t we give up being <em>control freaks</em>?</p>

          <h2><a href="/one-of-billions-7cf6b536578/">one of billions</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p><strong>One of billions.</strong> That’s all I am. That’s all I’ll ever be. It’s a dismally small number as a fraction, decimal and one in seven billion or so is just of the people alive right now. The gravity of this number hit me this past weekend after a late night conversation with my good friend, Erik. One is a small number, but with others, it doesn’t have to be insignificant.</p>

<p><strong>You were meant to be only one.</strong> God created you as a single being for many reasons. Without going too deep theologically, you were created as only one to be incomplete without God. You were created as one to be incomplete without others in your life. You were made as one to highlight the sufficiency and magnificence of God. You were made as one so that you would have to made complete outside of yourself.</p>

<p><strong>In a sense, we are born lacking.</strong> There is no significance in one. Swimming in a sea of billions, none is substantial or significant. However, when we begin relationships with others, that is when things start to get interesting. When we live life with those around us and diligently seek to find more to do this with, that fraction starts to amount to something. Things start happening. The world around us begins to come to life itself.</p>

<p><strong>Awakening at last.</strong> Our understanding of being born again causes a mental block, so I recommend we stick with everyone being born once. However, from my brief experience, that birth was not when you left your mother’s womb. No, it is when you begin to experience life in it’s ups and downs, highs and lows with those around you in a way that is devoted to God.</p>

<p><strong>We need help.</strong> If you’re like me, you’ve noticed there are just some things you’re not as good at and then there are things at which we just suck. That’s right, I am miserable at things like reminding people of Scripture and sharing my faith with complete strangers. Sure, I need to improve those aspects of my faith, but the heart of the matter is I need other people around me to help with those parts of life. I need others to round out my set of gifts.</p>

<p><strong>There is beauty in insufficiency.</strong> In my singularity, I am able to better see the brilliance of a God who lovingly created me to rely on Him foremost and my neighbors. Do you not see it for yourself? This importance of the individual is preposterous; it stains the beautiful collage that is the human experience. Sure, we’re each broken and flawed in our own way, but together we are woven to create an unparalleled masterpiece.</p>

<p>One on its own means little in such a populated world. One functioning as a part of a smaller group all working toward a common goal can mean much. One zombie existing aimlessly in a sea of the undead is inconsequential. One soul on fire in this world shines light on many. However, we can’t burn alone. We need God to supply the flame and others to help tend to it. Likewise, we tend to others’ flames and slowly, but surely we light the world around us on fire bringing one more zombie to life at a time. Together, we are more than <em>one in billions</em>.</p>

          <h2><a href="/growth-begins-with-darkness/">growth begins with darkness</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p><strong>Growth begins with darkness.</strong> Perhaps the scariest journey we can take is the one that leads inward. It’s dark and for many of us it’s foreign. There is little to comfort us as we’ve left the inner, deepest parts of us unexplored for years. We have an idea of what’s there, but it’s hard to tell which is more foreboding, the known or the unknown. It was at this very precipice I found myself the other night. At the edge of the cliff I stood trembling, but I took the only path that leads to life. Into the darkness I plunged.</p>

<p><strong>But I’m already alive.</strong> In a sense, yes, we all are. However, precious few of us are truly alive in the sense that we are fully awakened to the full truth of God and who we are in that context. Being alive is a genuine awareness of who God really is and a lifestyle that seeks to spread the good news implied in this revelation. People alive are immediately recognizable in the most crowded of rooms. No, you are probably not alive.</p>

<p><strong>We travel inwards to reach others.</strong> This paradox breaks down to the simple fact that we cannot give to others if we have nothing to offer them. Let me clarify, it is not that you are selling something about yourself here. No, if we want to pull others from the wreckage of this world, we must first have a way to pull them out as well as a knowledge of where safety is. If we are not right with God within ourselves, how can we help others with this great task? So, we must journey first within ourselves.</p>

<p><strong>Here’s the jumping off point.</strong> Every journey must start somewhere, so here’s where I started. Find a quiet place where you can be perfectly alone and write down every fear, doubt, insecurity that comes to mind. Write down the big, the small, the significant and the silly. Write down everything that comes to mind. Write until you can write no more. Here’s the fun part: burn it. Take delight in watching your list burn. Now, pray. Pray like you’ve never prayed before. Pray as if your life depended on it. Remind yourself of God’s promises (google some if you have to) and ask Him to remind you as well.</p>

<p><strong>You’re free.</strong> If you have accepted Jesus as your Savior, you have been freed from all the negativity of this world. It has no bearing on who you are. However, you’ve been freed so that you may live as such. Instead, we seem to pile on the shackles of doubt until we can walk no further and we are smothered, snuffed out like a faint candle. You were made to shine. So, do it! Cast aside all those weights and be unburdened once more as you were meant to be. Shine with an intensity the world has scarcely seen.</p>

<p>Why are you downtrodden? Why have you resigned yourself to the drudgery of this existence? Yes, life is tough, but it was never meant to be indefinite misery. We are lovingly called every day to joy through the breezes and the stillness. Yet, we ignore the gentle call. We don’t know where to begin and we are terrified of what we might find. It is no worse than anyone else. Those that have gone before you survived just fine and so will you. Friend, this state is not befitting someone of the royal family of God. Cast off your burdens and live alight with the truth of God’s freedom bought and paid long ago for you. Though it’s daunting, it is necessary as <em>growth begins with darkness</em>.</p>

          <h2><a href="/no-rest-for-the-weary/">no rest for the weary</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p><strong>No rest for the weary.</strong> Walking up to church (well, the school in which my church meets), I ran into a friend as I often do but he asked me a strange question. The question may not appear strange, but the way in which it was phrased elicited an even stranger response. “You staying busy?” my friend asked as we were briefly catching up. “It’s not busyness that I have a problem with, it’s the slowing down,” I replied as I soaked in the oddity of what just left my mouth. “I like that,” he said, a smile forming across his face.</p>

<p><strong>We’re asking the wrong question.</strong> The strangeness of my friend’s question was only revealed that evening as I sat down to continue reading <em>Emotionally Healthy Spirituality</em> by Pete Scazzero. As I began to read about the need for rest (sabbath in the Jewish and Christian traditions), the magnitude of my earlier conversation began to register. Our problem today is that we’re always asking, be it ourselves or others, if we’re staying busy. Busyness means everything. I’d even go so far as to say that busyness today equates to social currency. The less time we have, the more important and valuable we are in society.</p>

<p><strong>Quiet time isn’t enough.</strong> I’ve heard about taking regular rest before, but honestly I’ve come to believe that if I spend my half-hour with God everyday I’ll be sustained to the next. This isn’t how it works. When God created the earth, even He rested to showcase our dire need to rest and regularly. When I don’t rest, and I rarely if ever do, I go into the next week only feeling drained and reticent to begin a week that feels tacked onto the last. Life becomes grueling.</p>

<p><strong>What is this sabbath?</strong> Really, as we are all unique, it is whatever we want to make of it. However, it is a concentrated, uninterrupted 24 hours where we separate ourselves from the things which stress us. More than a few times, Jesus showed that what to some feels like work or labor, to others is relaxing. So, maybe you need to stay away from your work, physical activity, technology, people, etc. Find what works for you, but listen: this is the time you most of all need to spend <em>with</em> God, not talking at Him or making demands of Him.</p>

<p><strong>How do I be with God?</strong> Patience and time. It will not come immediately. Everything in our world, our culture speaks against the quieting down and idleness of sabbath. You will feel resistance from within and the world without you. Do not fear, the world will continue turning without you being glued to your cell phone. Spending time with God requires you to focus on just God. It is slow, deliberate breaths that can help keep you centered and thoughts directed at God. Those thoughts can be admiration, praise, questioning, even doubt. The point is to focus on God and Him alone. The key, however, is then to be silent. For how long? As long as it takes. For a people who struggle with 15 seconds of silence, it could feel pretty long, but He will answer.</p>

<p>We all struggle for one reason or another with resting and being silent. For me, it’s a matter of needing to earn God’s approval. What is it for you? What is it that keeps you pressing onward, continually perpetuating the weariness we all experience? What is it that tells you your weariness is what’s to be expected? What is it that draws you away from regularly resting and going to God to rejuvenate your soul? What is it that keeps you from being <em>with</em> God? These are questions we all need to answer, otherwise we’ll find there really is <em>no rest for the weary</em>.</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p><strong>Two broken pieces don’t make a whole.</strong> I’ve been mentally preparing for this post the past few days and then my brother just got engaged and I’ve been on the brink of scrapping this post more than twice. However, it’s time to share something I’m still in the process of learning, but bears sharing. I’ve posted about marriage before, but today gets personal.</p>

<p><strong>Marriage has been placed on a pedestal.</strong> For me, marriage has been a means of arriving, a way of attaining a social value and status. Most of all, it has been a way to always have someone around as a reminder of your validation and affirmation. After graduating and two eternity-filled years, I am farther from that goal than I was when I entered college.</p>

<p><strong>What is wrong with me?</strong> When you’ve been interested in a few people, you’ve tried out dating in the real world and none of it works out, this question will most likely work its way into your head. To be truthful, I’ve learned the answer is a paradoxical many things but nothing.</p>

<p><strong>So there is something wrong with me.</strong> Between my childhood and today, I’ve incurred many hurts and letdowns in life as that’s just the way life is. However, I began internalizing these as a kid and those have brewed and later hurts were internalized in more difficult ways. All that to say, I was more than startled when I realized the other day how messy my heart had become with all this garbage and clutter. If you take an honest look, you’ll see much the same.</p>

<p><strong>But there’s nothing wrong with me.</strong> In the sense that this is precisely where God has led your life, yes. The overarching fact is that there is nothing intrinsically wrong with you. Let me say that again, <em>there is nothing intrinsically wrong with you</em>. You are just as God intended and that is a beautiful wreck. The beauty comes from God, the wreck is merely a product of existence in a world of messed up people.</p>

<p><strong>Gluing pieces together that don’t fit.</strong> This is what happens when we don’t take the time to become whole once more before trying to fit another person into the equation. We think that if we are half and they are half, together it will equal one. First of all, you are not half a person and second of all, who’s to say your holes and cracks line up to one another? In not becoming whole as one with God, we make a couple really bad assumptions.</p>

<p><strong>I am not whole.</strong> I’ve come to acknowledge this fact. I’m even beginning to embrace it. And you? Come, take this bold first step with me. Admit this and you’ll feel a large weight drop from your shoulders. It’s not your job to make yourself whole and it never has been. It is no one else’s but God’s. Let Him guide you on the lovingly painful journey and He will hold your hand throughout. I’m just starting, so let’s go and we can all journey through it together. It was always meant that <em>two pieces don’t make a whole</em>.</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p><strong>We give because we can.</strong> I can tell you this statement does not perfectly fit with my perception of Christian duty. I think many of you would agree that we give because we’re called in the Bible to give and it looks good in front of others. Maybe that’s just me, but I think the reason why we give most times is because of some form of obligation. This view places too much emphasis on the individual. The fact is, giving is about the collective, it’s an outpouring of the abundance we’ve received that must flow to others as we can’t contain it all.</p>

<p><strong>Jesus came to serve.</strong> In this spirit, giving allows us to imitate Jesus. It allows us to step outside our selfish desires and show others they matter more to us than satisfying only ourselves. In a world that celebrates the individual, this message is hard to miss.</p>

<p><strong>We give to those in need.</strong> I know this sounds redundant, but I don’t know if we think about this as much as we should. Giving to those who have much benefits them little. Giving to those with little benefits them greatly. However, you have to ask yourself what truly constitutes poverty and it isn’t just possessions.</p>

<p><strong>We have been forgiven so we may be forgiven.</strong> I know that sounds confusing, but the forgiveness we receive from God is eternal. Therefore, as a Christian, we have received forgiveness for past, present and future transgressions. There is nothing to weigh us down. Likewise, we should forgive others so we don’t become a weight upon them.</p>

<p><strong>Giving takes work.</strong> As today’s Memorial Day, look around at all those who have fallen and those still in service. They are giving to you on a daily basis. Jesus, the disciples, apostles, etc. all show that there is pain in the offering (not always), but the reward infinitely outweighs the discomfort. Whatever we may endure, it pales to the reward that is paid out over an eternity.</p>

<p><strong>Reflect God’s glory</strong> Through receiving, we are whitewashed so that in giving we can reflect God’s glory. We evidence bits of God’s dominion over creation and His heart of love. In giving, we begin to look more like the Light we reflect and literally step outside ourselves as the Spirit is able to fully work in us.</p>

<p>If we are honestly following Jesus, then the love in our hearts will cause us to give without much thought to the contrary. We have been given so much that our heart cannot contain it all, therefore we have no option but to freely give some away. In this, we can imitate Jesus to people who are truly in need. We show that we are forgiven and, though it doesn’t always come easy, because of this we are free to forgive in the same way that God forgives. We mirror the character and the glory of God in our giving. Maybe today, while you’re grilling out with friends, family, you should ask yourself if you’re really giving of yourself out of freedom or out of bondage. We don’t give becase we have to; <em>we give because we can</em>.</p>

          <h2><a href="/knowledge-is-power/">knowledge is power</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p><strong>Knowledge is power.</strong> We’re taught these words at a very young age. If we’re not taught it explicitly, then it’s more that implied. We have become so ingrained with this idea that we devote our lives to always learning more. Honestly, I don’t take specific issue with this as knowledge is a good thing. However, when the hardest sentence for me to utter (as it’s never said proudly) is “I don’t know,” then I think this hints at a problem. When not knowing something is viewed as a curse or a malady, we limit ourselves and stunt our growth in every way (physically, emotionally, mentally, spiritually).</p>

<p><strong>We’re human.</strong> It is physically impossible to know everything there is to know because our brains cannot either store or recall all that data. It’s just how we were made and I think it serves to save us from ourselves. We aren’t mobile supercomputers. We are flesh and blood that in one way or another have to be taught everything we know. Now, pursuing knowledge all one’s life is fine, but keep in mind that’s still a process that, as stated, takes an entire lifetime.</p>

<p><strong>Embracing ignorance leads to wisdom.</strong> When Socrates asked the question “What is wisdom?” the conclusion at which he arrived was there were three kinds. The base was craftsman wisdom such as carpentry, metallurgy, etc. The higher was human wisdom and this was understanding what one doesn’t know. The highest wisdom was the knowledge of heaven. Socrates seemed to think of these as a spectrum and so it was crucial for one to pass from the basic form of wisdom to human wisdom before they could achieve wisdom beyond that. In other words, Socrates wrote this post several hundreds of years ago and I’m here to summarize.</p>

<p><strong>There’s no defeat.</strong> Not knowing and its recognition is as Socrates asserted not shameful. In fact, that in and of itself is a form of wisdom. Rather than defeat, it should be a victory as we shrug off the weight of having to perform in this area. Our worth does not come from our IQ or our trivia knowledge. We are not somehow less of a person. In fact, I’d say admitting we don’t know makes us the opposite.</p>

<p><strong>It is a jumping off point.</strong> “I don’t know” gives us the opportunity to figure it out, however. It gives us a place to begin an adventure in pursuit of the desired answer. Those words can be the launching point of our story, thrusting us into the heart of the action.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” are among the hardest words to say, but only because they’re so misunderstood. That sentence carries with it such a heavy context of shame and worthlessness that we avoid them at all cost. We feel less valuable and even less of a human at times, but only because we don’t rightly understand God’s view of wisdom. As a Christian, we are called to always have an answer, but “I don’t know” is one. Instead of shame, those words should be met with excitement and joy. We have identified an opportunity to grow and to understand ourselves, the world around us and even God in a clearer way. If this is true, then how can there be shame here? So, let’s rejoice at the opportunity to increase, as <em>maybe knowledge really is power</em>.</p>

          <h2><a href="/community-is-learning-how-to-receive/">community is learning how to receive</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p><strong>Community is learning how to receive.</strong> Last Monday, I talked about the broader issue that <a href="http://104.193.143.57/~waywar13/ce/2012/05/14/community-is-threatening/" title="Community Is Threatening">Community Is Threatening</a>. Today, I want to focus on one side of that coin, the receiving within the context of community. Because, while we generally know we need some sort of community, we don’t understand that receiving is just as important in this setting as giving. Without the recipient, to whom do we have to give?</p>

<p><strong>We equate worth with giving.</strong> If you’re anything like me, what you have to give others is what you have to offer in community. Therefore, the amount you have to give is your social equity. It defines what you’re worth. I hope you’re seeing the flaw in these characters flashing before your eyes. If this is true and we believe God to be the giver of all good things, then we are doomed to worthlessness forever and we should just end it. However, this is patently not the case and we should rejoice in this fact daily. We are not judged by what we have to give as receiving has an intrinsic value as well.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“One of the Pharisees asked him to eat with him, and he went into the Pharisee’s house and reclined at the table. And behold, a woman of the city, who was a sinner, when she learned that he was reclining at table in the Pharisee’s house, brought an alabaster flask of ointment, and standing behind him at his feet, weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears and wiped them with the hair of her head and kissed his feet and anointed them with the ointment…Then turning toward the woman he said to Simon [the Pharisee], ‘Do you see this woman? I entered your house; you gave me no water for my feet, but she has wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair. You gave me no kiss, but from the time I came in she has not ceased to kiss my feet. You did not anoint my head with oil, but she has anointed my feet with ointment. Therefore I tell you, her sins, which are many, are forgiven — for she loved much. But he who is forgiven little, loves little.’ And he said to her, ‘Your sins are forgiven.’” — Luke 7:36–38,44–48</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Even Jesus accepted being served.</strong> In this case, the woman was giving everything she had of value and in a way even below servants. But Jesus understood the value of receiving in this moment. He understood that while He came to serve, He also needed to give us an example of receiving.</p>

<p><strong>In receiving, we give others the pleasure of giving.</strong> We all need to give. However, we need people who can also receive, otherwise there can be no giving. Then, we are denying our souls what they were meant to do. Yes, we were made to give and give until it hurts. But we need to receive so that we do not become selfish in our giving and we allow others to experience the same joy.</p>

<p><strong>In receiving, we acknowledge that we are not God.</strong> We do not have an infinite store within us from which to keep giving. We need to receive to refill on the very grace that we so desire to spread around us. God uses others’ giving in our lives to refresh our ability to do so. Otherwise, He knows we will only burn out as many have and are continuing to do so.</p>

<p>As I also said a month ago, <a href="http://104.193.143.57/~waywar13/ce/2012/04/16/why-community/" title="Why Community?">community is about both give and take</a>. Without one aspect, the whole system is broken. Without one aspect, <em>we</em> become broken in how we relate to the world. This is not how God designed life. We need to receive so others may give. We need to receive so that we can continue to give. Finally, we need to give because we are not God and He is the reason we can give in the first place. So today, take that opportunity to simply receive and receive well. <em>Community is about learning how to receive</em>.</p>

          <h2><a href="/weve-all-been-hurt-by-the-church-15218c1475/">we’ve all been hurt by the church</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p><strong>We’ve all been hurt by the Church.</strong> In one way or another, I think we’ve all been hurt by the Church (the global collection of churches who worship Jesus as God’s son and our Savior). As a result, many have turned away and written off this institution that has been struggling for nearly two thousand years. I want to say right now that I am sorry for the pain you’ve suffered at the hands of the Church and that I am with you. Today, I want to tell you a little about my story, pose an explanation and then ask for your stories and ideas.</p>

<p><strong>You can’t judge a book by its cover.</strong> I lived outside Philly for a year and immediately started attending a church suggested by a few friends. It was a time of great spiritual growth for me as I was taking on issues with God that had lingered for longer than I care to remember. Between work and family, I spent the latter half of November and almost all of December away. When I came back to the church that January, I was a ghost. I had been disowned and voted off the island without knowing there had been a vote. I was no longer “in”. I tried for a few weeks, but no progress was made. People asked where I had been, but these same people had my number. I could tell things were going nowhere, so I left.</p>

<p><strong>I found a new church.</strong> This isn’t the typical response, but in my case I felt it was the logical next step. I started going to another church in the area and the only reason I’m not attending that church today is because I had to move. However, why would someone go back into the arms of the very organization that so brutally and suddenly rejected them? There is one reason, but it’s not a very satisfying one to many, I’m sure.</p>

<p><strong>We’re all broken in our own way.</strong> What does that have to do with the price of tea in China, you ask? Look, the church is attended, led and everything else by broken people. The very same people who are cracked, torn, hurt and bruised just like you and me are the ones running the show. They aren’t put into place specifically because they’re holier than the rest of us, but because God has a plan for that person in that specific position. Sometimes it’s to help the church around them grow and sometimes it’s to help the leaders themselves grow. And if Paul himself said that no one can judge the thoughts of a man but that man’s spirit, well I’m apt to believe him here (I Corinthians 2:11). I don’t think the church is anymore messed up than most corporations running today. I just think it gets bad press and we judge it by some higher standard we created especially for the Church.</p>

<p>I’m not going to sugarcoat it, there’s a lot wrong with the Church. However, I think the issues, while severe, are no more dire than the rest of this world. The difference is the Church is the one muddying God’s name in the process. That, I believe, is the real shame. Well, now it’s your turn. How have you been/are you being hurt by the Church? What then was/is your response and why? There’s no one here to judge, because <em>we’ve all been hurt by the Church</em>.</p>

          <h2><a href="/community-is-threatening/">community is threatening</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p><strong>Community is threatening.</strong> I was finishing up playing for the small crowd Friday night when the words, “Who’s here to see Cameron?” rung out. An overwhelming majority of the room raised their hand and in that moment I was both humbled and amazed. I do have a pretty good support system around me and I couldn’t be more thankful for that fact. However, this is rare. Community is essential to life, yet oftentimes we resist it. We resist because it’s not safe and it threatens the very identities onto which we desperately cling.</p>

<p><strong>Community is about vulnerability.</strong> In community, we must first strip ourselves of our Superman alter egos. We have to come to terms with our mortality and imperfection and this doesn’t bode well especially in today’s society. We admit our faults and look for help. The bottom line is we have to admit we cannot succeed alone. This very fact cuts us to the core. It is more than uncomfortable.</p>

<p><strong>Community is about others first.</strong> While we may love those around us, the fact of the matter is our friends, family and neighbors come second in life behind us. Besides, what can we give them if we don’t have it together ourselves? We’ve bought into this half-truth and it’s poisoning our society. The fact is, no one will ever have it together. Therefore, we can’t wait to be fully put together ourselves before we begin to live an outward focused life. No, we must live life this way from the get-go so that we can live life together as was always the design.</p>

<p><strong>Community is about living life together.</strong> The spectrum of life’s experiences, from bliss down to lamentation, was meant to be lived together with others. We were meant to bring joy into the lives of others in the good times and receive support in the bad. However, this means disclosing all things to our trusted support. It means ditching preconceived notions of vileness and shame. It takes a trust that the people around us are just as base and looking also to be made whole once more. It takes laying aside our need to be better.</p>

<p><strong>Community is give and take.</strong> It cannot be one or the other. Community must be both. Without the give, how can we continue to take in good conscience? On the flip side, if we continue to give, from where do we receive? In other words, we cannot be hoarders of care and encouragement, but we also are not bottomless wells. Community is, like breathing, a two step process. Without one, the other cannot occur and the entire system breaks down.</p>

<p>Community goes against some of the very core elements of our society today. It subjugates the individual to the servitude of others. Community casts aside delusions of a man being an island. It breaks down success and accomplishment. It leaves us feeling weak, but loved. We feel imperfect, but secure. Community changes our very worldview, slowing us down so that we can finally breathe and contemplate together. Next week, we’ll look at the take in community, but today, ask yourself what you struggle with most in the idea of community. For me, it’s a fear of being seen as ugly inside. <em>Why for you is community threatening?</em></p>

          <h2><a href="/showing-up/">showing up</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p><strong>Showing up.</strong> For those of you that know me, I also moonlight as a singer/songwriter and I’ll be a part of my first show this weekend. It’s a showcase of a few artists, so nothing horribly stressful, but I’ve been nervous about it now for nearly 2 weeks (OK, a month, but who’s counting?). Yes, you could say I’m a little anxious, but not too bad. However, after a couple conversations in particular, I begin to understand this emotion in a whole new light. I’m understanding it as reinforcing that God is truly sovereign and life is not about me or my abilities. Instead, life is really more about showing up and letting Him do the work through under-qualified people such as myself.</p>

<p><strong>David was a shepherd.</strong> Not only was he a shepherd, but he was the youngest in the family and still God chose to use him. David with conceivably no battle knowledge whatsoever, let alone experience, felled the champion of the Philistines, Goliath, with only a rock and a slingshot. You may argue that David could have become very skilled with his slingshot, but to that I say try to hit a temple on your first shot. I doubt David was <em>that</em> good. David showed up, a shepherd to a bloodbath, and God won the war.</p>

<p><strong>The disciples were relatively menial, lower class workers at best.</strong> The people Jesus chose to associate closest with were fishermen, tax collectors and people most in society did not want to rub up against, let alone choose for positions of importance. There were hundreds and thousands of Pharisees and Sadducees more theologically qualified, but God chose otherwise. Throughout the ministry of Jesus, the disciples simply did not get it. At every turn they question Jesus missing some of the most basic of truths. Even still, God used all of them (save Judas who hung himself) to build His Church. If there is some inkling of qualification, I’m missing it here.</p>

<p><strong>“If we always keep waiting, we’ll never be ready.”</strong> Words from a Mat Kearney song , are so true here. If we’re always concerned with how prepared and qualified we are, we’ll never accomplish anything. There are just some times, some days that we need to exercise a little faith and just show up. I say this again, because I need the reminder: it’s not about us and it never was. This may sound harsh, but I find it relieving to know that the weight of the world I feel has only been conjured by my imagination.</p>

<p>I’m giving my all and putting in as much practice as I can for this show coming up this weekend, but nothing more. When the time comes, I’m picking up my guitar and doing what I have to do. I may not be David or a disciple, but I am no less qualified than any. Whether I am “ready” or not, I’ll get up in front of the crowd (big or small) and put my faith in the One who it’s always been about, the One who never fails on His promises. Now it’s your turn. What’s got you nervous, anxious? In whatever way you feel under-qualified, embrace it because God is good and He has you. Because in the end, we realize it was never about us to begin with. Instead, we’re called to showing up so we can get a front row seat to what <em>He’s</em> doing. So, ask yourself today, do we get upset at God for our own lack of showing up?</p>

          <h2><a href="/every-good-story-needs-relationships/">every good story needs relationships</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p><strong>Every good story needs relationships.</strong> What story, be it novel, movie, short, doesn’t have the protagonist relating with other characters? It just doesn’t happen. Likewise, we need people in our own stories. We need people to journey alongside us. However, this doesn’t just happen. It takes a little work and that’s precisely what we’re talking about here. We need people in our lives, but the ones worth keeping around don’t take too much to achieve that.</p>

<p><strong>“I thought relationships were supposed to be easy.”</strong> Um, no. At the same time, they’re not supposed to take a degree in rocket science either. Instead, they lie somewhere in the vast middle ground. The reason why they cannot be easy is because relationships are between broken people. You may take offense to this, but that’s only because this is a fact that you need to come to terms with and the sooner the better.</p>

<p><strong>We’re all broken in our own ways.</strong> Yes, this is quite true. Fight it as you will, know that I tried and lost. Being broken isn’t a status like leprosy in the ancient world. Brokenness is merely a product of life on this earth. No one is perfect, thus we all perpetuate our imperfection, our brokenness. When broken meets broken, things are bound to get messy.</p>

<p><strong>Let’s dive into the mess.</strong> Alright, so I’ve begun to paint a dingy picture of relationships, but only to temper our expectations here. We need to dive in because while relationships are messy and will leave us hurting deeply at times, we need them because of the great reward that renders the pain inconsequential. We risk who we are in relationships (whether you realize it or not), but that is only because deep down we know the reward outweighs the cost. Therefore, it only makes sense to fight for this wager of self.</p>

<p><strong>It isn’t about you.</strong> You’d think I’d know this by now, but this past weekend was a wakeup call for me. Relationship teaches us to take ourselves a little less seriously and kicks out the legs of the stool we’re balancing on known as pride. We are no more important than the other in this relationship and it’s our responsibility and privilege to show this person that we understand that fact. We get the honor of experiencing the joy in serving, through act, word, emotion, the other person in each relationship. That God would grant us this present is a beautiful picture of grace.</p>

<p><strong>Use words.</strong> Pick up the phone, write a card or letter, sit down and have a conversation. What this looks like specifically depends on a few factors like distance, but bottom line is relationships need communication to exist, let alone grow. Initiate that and keep it going regularly. How can you care for someone whom you don’t know? Likewise, they can’t care for you without this regular contact. Do it for them, but also know you’re doing it for yourself as well. You’d be surprised how appreciated a call can be.</p>

<p><strong>Go out of your way.</strong> Remember, we’re not that important and neither is our schedule. I’m not talking about anything major here. In fact, relationships are about the little things, so small actions that show care are what I mean. Whether that’s bringing said person a latte during a long day or a rock that reminds them of a better time in their/your collective life, it doesn’t matter but do <em>something</em>. To you it may seem trivial, but I assure you it is not to them. It wouldn’t be to you if the shoe were on the other foot. Plus, you’ve now put yourself in the 99.999% in this person’s world, because the rest of the world is too busy. Don’t be the rest of the world.</p>

<p><strong>Initiate.</strong> If you don’t, who will? I know, you can’t be the only one giving in the relationship, but the opposite can’t be true either. Give a little. You’ll be given far more in the exchange than you gave up and really, what are you giving up to begin with? It doesn’t necessarily matter what, but it shows that you care and they matter to you. And who doesn’t want to matter to someone? It isn’t giving them importance, though. Instead, it is merely recognizing the importance intrinsically carried by God’s most prized creation.</p>

<p><strong>Stories don’t function without relationships and neither do lives.</strong> Relationships aren’t easy, in fact they’re highly messy, but they are possibly the most rewarding aspect of living on this earth. However, to be in relationship well, it takes work, but not the work of slaying dragons. No, relationships take the work of water wearing through rock. Slowly, steadily we drip away at the rock not seeing the immediate impact, but soon enough we have created a great river. Baby steps, strung together, even can make a journey. In the process, we recognize the other’s intrinsic value imputed by the Creator, but also have it recognized within ourselves and that in turn glorifies God, Himself. Now look at your story. Where are the other characters? <em>Every story needs relationships</em>.</p>

  <p>“So now faith, hope, and love abide, these three; but the greatest of these is love.” — I Corinthians 13:13</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Why love?</strong> I think the better question in light of this verse is why not? Christianity is a rather simple religion despite what we’ve come to see and believe. I chose love because it is the main pillar. Love, unconditional, true love, is an attempt at recourse in a faith that has become more of a support group that people have to attend weekly than a way of life. If we want to right this ship off course, then we have to get down to fundamentals. We have to understand our faith on that level, but then live it out everyday. The wise face the same death as the foolish, but those acting in love have never been put to shame.</p>

<p><strong>Love matters.</strong> I now and I hope we all do have a better idea of what that love is to look like. However, this is all loss if we don’t put it into action. If we don’t show love, then it is like holding onto the cure to a deadly disease while our friend/loved one is dying in the next room. If this Christian life is so important to us, then what are we doing about it? Am I off in my conclusion friends? Did we not learn a little? A lot? Is it not time to take others along with us on our <em>journey to love</em>?</p>

          <h2><a href="/imbalance-d024eb6046a/">imbalance</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p><strong>Imbalance.</strong> I think if we’re honest, we all struggle with it in some fashion. I know I never seem to have enough time to do all the things I think I need to do. This imbalance leaves us tired, stretched thin, frustrated, etc. Being an ideas person, I thought this was just how my life was supposed to go. However, a brief conversation with my pastor turned the very idea of balance on its ear when he asked, “What is balance? I mean, what does balance mean and is it Biblical?”</p>

<p><strong>What is balance?</strong> This question had me reeling, because I knew that I couldn’t define it. Balance falls in the category of words like normal and regular. They are all words used as Valium to the soul. They are meant to tranquilize hearts meant to be fierce and bold. They are the shrink wrap applied to our non-uniform selves. Balance is but a means of drawing us from our God-intended pursuits. Jesus never intended for His life to be balanced and neither should we.</p>

<p><strong>What does balance mean?</strong> You’d think that I could describe to you what balance means, but other than a physics definition, I’m stumped. I cannot tell you what a balanced life looks like. Pardon me, but to be honest, it sounds like Utopian hell. It sounds like a scene out of any movie that falls in this genre and we all know how those end. To take a shot at it, balance means sedate, lackluster, stagnant, boring. Even this is a poor definition, but I think this is the point to terms not intended in a certain context.</p>

<p><strong>Is balance Biblical?</strong> By the time my pastor had reached this question, I was running for the trenches. However, in that moment of panic (I hate being told I’m wrong), I knew enough to answer, “No,” flatly. But why isn’t it Biblical? My mind racing sputtered out, “Because following Christ is a headlong pursuit.” He told me to think about it and left me to my thoughts which then percolated like a south Pacific tsunami in the middle of Summer. I don’t remember the fifteen minute walk home.</p>

<p><strong>Imbalance is key.</strong> The Bible is fraught with people living horribly imbalanced lives. However, what is balance? Likening life to the solar system, when the sun is at its center, everything is balanced perfectly. Why should life not resemble this with God as our sun? Why should God not be our central and sole pursuit? Isn’t that how we were designed in the first place? Just look at the Garden. Until the apple, God was Adam and Eve’s only concern in life. This doesn’t work, you say? Tell me, how doesn’t it?</p>

<p>When Jesus sought disciples, He only told them to come follow Him. There were no mentions of splitting time or creating harmony in life. Balance is a word that over time, we’ve decontextualized to refer to an ideal lifestyle. In fact, Revelations speaks of God spitting out the lukewarm, which is what balance is really. Balance means whatever we want it to mean, but in the context of life, it has no intrinsic meaning. There isn’t any basis for this in the Christian lifestyle. The Christian life is one sold out completely for God. It is a single-minded pursuit that prioritizes based on our individual callings and gifts. It serves the Father at all times. Maybe I’ve taken this too far and I’m the imbalanced one. Ask yourselves and then respond, are we called to live a life of “<em>imbalance</em>?”</p>

          <h2><a href="/love-never-ends/">love never ends</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p><strong>Love never ends.</strong> Who knew I could have such trouble with three words. Experience certainly doesn’t confirm this assertion of love. No, my experience mostly denies this. When couples all around us are separating, divorcing, it’s hard to fathom that love doesn’t have a threshold or an expiration.</p>

<p><strong>This is why we love old couples.</strong> Deep down I think we all realize the truth about love and seeing old couples reminds us of that knowledge. I haven’t met a single person who thinks ill of old couples. Likewise, I haven’t met a person who’s met my grandparents and thought anything less than they were “the cutest thing ever.” I’d have to agree. They are one of the few examples that fortifies my faith in this aspect.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Beloved, let us love one another, for love is from God, and whoever loves has been born of God and knows God. Anyone who does not love does not know God, because God is love. In this the love of God was made manifest among us, that God sent his only Son into the world, so that we might live through him. In this is love, not that we have loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins. Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another. No one has ever seen God; if we love one another, God abides in us and his love is perfected in us.” — I John 4:7–12</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Love is from God.</strong> God is love and He is its origin. Therefore, love by association cannot die. If God is love and love ends, then God must change, but this is impossible for an immutable God. Based on its origin, we can’t only have so much love to give as has been said many times before. God sent Love down two milennia ago and Love is still very active in the world today. If you claim to love and it’s not a love perfected, then it isn’t love at all.</p>

<p><strong>God’s love is perfected in us.</strong> I read this verse and it brought me to tears. God sent His Son so that we might live through the Son and in so doing, God’s love becomes perfected in us. The implications of this I cannot comprehend. This statement alone makes love’s unending nature impossible to grasp. Suffice it to say, love perfected knows no bounds. I want to be overwhelmed, however what’s impressed upon me is the possibilities of this love are infinite. If this doesn’t excite you, then I’m not sure what to say.</p>

<p>It’s easy to think that we are the pallbearers of love, carrying in vain it’s heavy casket, but this couldn’t be any further from the truth. Love showed on the third day what it’s trying to tell us today. We know in our hearts love isn’t dead and will never die as there is nothing on this earth that can overcome it. This is because love is from God. Love is from the God that is love and doesn’t change, therefore neither will that which describes Him. That love is then perfected in us when we accept the sacrifice of His Son and willingly submit our lives to His perfect love. In other words, we take part in God Himself in this glorious exchange. Dear friend, lift your eyes and press on because <em>love never ends</em>. Or, tell me, does it?</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p><strong>We leave impressions everywhere.</strong> That’s just the fact of the matter. We meet new people all the time, everyday for some of us, and each new encounter is an impression. Each new person is left with an idea of who they think we are. In some cases, they’re left with a different idea of who they think God is or isn’t. The fact is, I don’t think we’re mindful enough of this. I don’t believe we live intentionally in light of this truth.</p>

<p><strong>It had been 6 months.</strong> That was how long ago I was last down in Charlottesville before this past weekend. Granted, I’d spent four years there graduating from the University of Virginia, but I only make it back down there but once every 6–12 months now. Anyway, I was with my dad and friend Erik and we went to the bar where my dad and I frequented when he’d make his visits when I was in school. That day was like a drawn out version of Cheers. Person after person came who worked at the bar came in and each time was like old friends reacquainting once again. It got me thinking.</p>

<p><strong>Who am I?</strong> I’m no one special. By all standards, I am a very ordinary person. However, that has no bearing on the responsibility I carry. I am an ambassador for Christ, the face of Jesus to my world. As such, my responsibility to my world is to represent Him well. However, it wasn’t until this past weekend that I realized what kind of reach my influence had. The fact is, we all have a platform with those around us, we all have reach and we all have influence. It’s what we do with those that make us different.</p>

<p><strong>I am God’s.</strong> That is who I am and I bear the mark of God to the world. That, friends, is an honor. It is an honor above all others. There is none greater than to be able to proudly bear His name. Why should I not show off what I’ve been given like I would a new pair of shoes or a car? In much the same way, why would I not talk about it? Is being God’s own less valuable than a car? A pair of shoes? It’d appear that it was.</p>

<p>We’ve been blessed with a great responsibility. Really, it’s a blessing to have such an honor, but it’s not without a responsibility. We don’t deserve this honor, but that’s not the point. We have it, now what are we going to do with it? I pray that we don’t just sit on our stools wasting it. <em>Whether we know it or not, we leave impressions everywhere</em>.</p>

          <h2><a href="/love-endures-all-things/">love endures all things</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p><strong>Love endures all things.</strong> If you’ve been reading along, congratulations on making it this far. If you haven’t, don’t worry it’s not too late. Thinking about how to write this post, I wanted to essentially repeat <a href="http://104.193.143.57/~waywar13/ce/2012/03/08/love-is-not-resentful/" title="Love Is Not Resentful">Love Is Not Resentful</a>, but I realized I’d be missing out on so much if I were to limit the scope of this post to just that. So, I set out to understand this phrase and here is where it led me.</p>

<p><strong>Love has no kryptonite.</strong> There isn’t anything that love cannot overcome. I’m sure you can come up with a few ‘but’s right now, however hold that for later. Pure, unadulterated love can overcome any act, situation or circumstance. There is no qualification in the text. Love endures. End of story.</p>

<p><strong>This isn’t our experience.</strong> I’m not trying to discount our experience, because I haven’t seen this type of love, either. This love that endures all makes no sense, especially in this context. But, that’s only because this world is populated with people full of good intentions, but little idea how to put them into action.</p>

<p><strong>Loving well is hard.</strong> That’s right. It takes time and effort, but the end result is a love stronger than Superman. I’d hinted at it earlier, but I had to say it. There is nothing greater on this earth, and as Jesus showed us on the cross, or in the heavens than pure love. There are few descriptive phrases about God in the Bible, but the fact that God is love (or some form of this) appears multiple times tells us something both about Him and about love itself. Part of our likeness of God is our great ability to love, but it doesn’t just work right out of the box.</p>

<p><strong>Love redeems.</strong> I think this is the ultimate statement about love. The fact is, without love, we all would be lost, hopeless. Without love, we would all be left for dead in a proverbial ditch. God wasn’t satisfied with this scenario, therefore He sent His Son to impute His perfection to us all. Sinners of all kinds and degrees were redeemed and made perfect before God on that day. This is the power of love.</p>

<p><strong>What can love not do?</strong> I’m genuinely asking you now. Love, against our experiences, is greater than anything with which we will come into contact. It’s up to us to put in the time, the effort and steadily work toward this pristine opportunity. We don’t have to, but the decision is ours. <em>Today, will you begin or continue the work toward a love like God’s that endures all things?</em></p>

          <h2><a href="/why-community/">why community?</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p><strong>Why community?</strong> The topic of community has come up several times recently in posts and I feel like it’s time to begin to understand why community is such an integral part to this life. Honestly, I couldn’t begin to undertake that task until I was reflecting yesterday on a conversation I’d had with someone about music. It struck me that artists and people in community share one very important purpose.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Then God said, ‘Let us make man in our image, after our likeness.’” Genesis 1:26a</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>We all need to share.</strong> Now, I’m not saying that we all have a need to share <em>everything</em>, because you get too close too my food and you’re not walking away the same as you did before. In all seriousness, we were designed to share and be shared with in this life. We share experiences, joys, trials, stories, meals (just not mine), etc. If you need any more proof, skim your Bible and you’ll see the Trinity is the perfect example with each entity sharing and accepting in a distinct way.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“For just as the body is one and has many members, and all the members of the body, though many, are one body, so it is with Christ. For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body — Jews or Greeks, slaves or free — and all were made to drink of one Spirit.” — I Corinthians 12:12–13</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>We need to give.</strong> Being both a songwriter and a person with high relational needs, I understand this very well. My relational needs tell me that I need to give to receive. Sure, this doesn’t hold with grace, but in earthly relationships this theory I think we all can agree applies. What was so eye opening however was the artist’s perspective that breaks giving down to a matter of calling. If we’re not giving of our calling, sharing our specific gifts, then we are selfish. We’re rejecting the gifts God has given us and depriving the world of enjoying God in that particular way.</p>

<p><strong>We need to receive.</strong> Even God chooses not to give all the time. If the self-sustaining Creator rejoices in receiving, like a father does his infant’s first finger painting, then that says a lot about us. We have no such self-sustenance, therefore we intrinsically need to receive. We need to receive, because we need God and so often does He work through the giving of others. We need to receive because, like breathing, we need also to inhale God’s grace after we have exhaled through our own giving. Without receiving, eventually we burn out and can no longer give.</p>

<p><strong>Problems arise when we’re without.</strong> Rarely do you see problems with people who are actively engaged in true community, with friends knowing the intimate details of one another’s lives and sharing times of joy and grief alike. No, it’s when people don’t feel like they have anyone sharing with them or to share with that lives go awry. Has there ever been a person who killed or tried to kill him or her self because community was too overwhelmingly blessing their soul? I’m going out on a limb and saying no. Loneliness, being out of community is what drives people to this. I know, as I had someone I knew take this route about a year ago.</p>

<p>Community is crucial not only to the Christian life, but to human life as we know it. Community provides the sense of acceptance and value that God intended. Yes, God is our ultimate source of validation and affirmation, but we will always derive some of this from our community. In that community we need to give because it is our duty of ministry as well as a service to our fellow man. Likewise, we need to receive so that we can continue to give and grow in the knowledge of God’s love. We need all this because many of us have seen the consequences either firsthand or been told by friends. <em>Why community? Because through giving and receiving, we are able to carry on in the way He designed us.</em></p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p><strong>Love hopes all things.</strong> Now, you may be asking what’s the difference between last week’s post <a href="http://104.193.143.57/~waywar13/ce/2012/04/05/love-believes-all-things/" title="Love Believes All Things">Love Believes All Things</a> and this topic as I’ve been asking the past three days. I think this important delineation can be found in a story here.</p>

<p><strong>I’ve had some interesting friends.</strong> One friend in particular always had new stories. But, you knew that half of them were completely made up, while the other half were half true. However, he would give you the shirt off his back if he thought you needed it. Now, on one occasion I had gotten word that he’d crossed a line that most friends don’t cross. I talked to him and he denied it. This happened again and I was left with the dilemma of what seemed a recurring theme. I wanted to believe him, to assume he’d never cross that line. However, my hope in him was shaken and I cut ties.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Well, a man ain’t ashamed of the things that he’s done. My past is my past, that’s where I came from.<br />
“My Love Is My Love” — Peter Bradley Adams</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Hope is belief in the future.</strong> In a world of financial scams and general mistrust, this doesn’t happen. I think we’d all say we <em>hope</em> for a better future, but the word we really mean is <em>wish</em>. We cognitively believe there is better on the horizon, but we’ve seen too much of the past to think it probable. This is not hope, friends. This is not love. Love can’t continue in the way of a loan officer.</p>

<p><strong>Leave room for grace.</strong> We’ve swung a long way from the days of “turn the other cheek”. Sure, we’re no longer trying to be doormats, but we’re still no closer to following the example of Christ. We need to use wisdom here, but everyone who wrongs us (given enough time, everyone will) does not necessarily fall into a pattern of transgression. We cannot rate people in our lives on a relationship credit score. The moment we do that, we’re actually telling God that He shouldn’t have taken a chance in us as we’re only going to fall back into our wicked ways as well.</p>

<p><strong>The hearts of men are evil.</strong> Yes, this is undoubtedly true. But, let’s remember the definition of evil here is anything short of God. This doesn’t mean that everyone walking around this rock is looking for the next baby to murder. That was a bit extreme, but I think you get my point. On some level, everyone wants to be good. Some of us just aren’t very good at expressing that. All of us are broken and we need to expect that when we choose to love. Relationships, like the people that comprise them, are broken pieces of work in progress.</p>

<p><strong>Hope is more than a fragile wish for the future.</strong> Hope is a wholehearted belief that a situation, person, group is capable and desiring of more. Hope is the knife that looses others from the rope tying them to the boulders of their past weighing them down. Hope is what allows us to move forward in life and, more importantly, bring others along with us for the ride. Without hope, we are all marooned alone on separate islands miles from anything. Let grace abound today, because as it was meant to, <em>love hopes all things</em>.</p>

          <h2><a href="/what-does-resurrection-mean/">what does resurrection mean?</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p><strong>What does resurrection mean?</strong> I love Easter more than most people, but I have to admit this question has entered my mind and it’s only a small part of the larger question. We celebrate Easter, but so what? Some guy Jesus was raised from the dead big whoop. He was sentenced to death hanging from a cross like many others and was raised from the dead as has happened a few times before.</p>

<p><strong>I don’t see a problem here.</strong> Most of us don’t see a problem with this summation, but there’s a glaring problem with this account. It explains nothing about why Easter should be important. For those churchgoing of us, we’ve heard tales of being saved from sin, salvation and eternal life. To be honest, I don’t think that makes much of a difference down here in the trenches of daily life.</p>

<p><strong>There has to be something more.</strong> Maybe I’m just playing devil’s advocate, however all the salvation talk and eternity is great, but today I can’t fathom a reason why that should tangibly matter. Then, amongst all the noise and the peeps, the truth hit me like one of those marshmallowy goo-ball-for-chicks being heated in a microwave.</p>

<p><strong>God’s love isn’t about us.</strong> While salvation and heaven are awesome things to think about, I think our view of Easter falls short. Easter wasn’t about those ethereal gifts, but something far more tangible, yet unfathomable. While those I try to give thanks for every day, the real gift I am only beginning to grasp as its breadth is infinite.</p>

<p><strong>God gave us Himself.</strong> Easter is about God coming down as a man, stooping to our depths and loving us physically, then giving up an earthly life so that we could experience Him forever and always. Easter is the consummation of that grand scheme. It is the storm after the two days of calm.</p>

<p><strong>Heaven and earth rejoices.</strong> I could write forever about this and not have said a thing about how great God’s gift of Easter was. On Easter, God showed us forever a foretaste of how great and awesome He is. All the iniquity of the world from beginning to end weighed upon His shoulders. Even His own wrath He withstood. God did all this so that He might be reunited with His beloved creation. He withstood everything so that we might enjoy the greatest gift in the universe; that gift being Himself, the Ultimate Father.</p>

<p><strong>Do we even care?</strong> No, by most popular accounts suggested by actions we don’t. It breaks my heart that I am in the majority here. Sure, it’s the day after Easter, but Jesus is just as risen today as He was a thousand years ago. We need to ask ourselves the question daily, “How does the death and resurrection of Jesus matter to me today?” If it does, then our actions will show. If it does, then you can stop reading now.</p>

<p>We’ve been given a gift we’ll never appreciate. We don’t have the facilities to fully appreciate this gift. The Alpha and Omega has made Himself freely available to us, yet we are confined to think about it in terms of what we get when we die. Easter isn’t about death, so much as it is about being truly alive at last. We can’t accomplish that with the Life. Later today, tomorrow morning, the next day, will you ask yourself, “<em>What does resurrection mean?</em>”</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p><strong>Love believes all things</strong>. This statement makes love out to be some gullible kook out of touch with reality. You know what, maybe it is. Maybe that’s exactly the point with love here. Love isn’t analytical, taking the pieces of a situation and capable of merely rearranging them like some sort of math problem. Love isn’t emotional, driven by fits and outbursts that defy even the best psychologists. No, though love has these characteristics, love is more than analytical and more than emotional.</p>

<p><strong>Love seems to be some gullible kook out of touch with reality.</strong> We use the phrase “love came down” in regards to the coming of Jesus, but I want you to think about that in this context. Jesus was definitely out of touch (so it seemed) with the reality of that day. He took the social order, norms and turned them all on their heads. However, He was never without reason. There was always a direct purpose. In fact, they were so saturated with meaning, we’re still trying to understand them fully today.</p>

<p><strong>Love isn’t trite.</strong> Even Jesus’ most memorable meltdowns (think about Him flipping over tables in the temple) aren’t just for the sake of reacting. Love seems to maintain a higher standard and believe it’s attainable. The latter is very important. Love isn’t your boss weighing down on you because they have authority over you. No, love bears down on those it believes are meant for more.</p>

<p><strong>Love sees more.</strong> I mentioned love seeing more than what’s there in a situation, and I want to reassert that fact. Love lifts both the <em>lover</em> and the <em>loved</em> to new heights and knows both can reach them. Love, not seeing what is prevalent, focuses on what is actually there. It doesn’t get bogged down in the roles and characters we all portray both online and in real life, but it sees to the core. Love isn’t a physical entity, so it doesn’t have to dig through all the layers. It sees only the heart, but at the same time it sees the <em>whole</em> heart.</p>

<p><strong>God is love.</strong> If God is love, then what we experience must be His whisperings. Laying aside theological differences, love is the part of God, who sees the hearts of all men, still prevalent in this world wreaking havoc on the status quo today. Love is the urging of the Spirit moving through people, you and me, creating rays of light from darkness. I’m no physicist, but I know this isn’t supposed to make sense.</p>

<p>Love isn’t a mathematician, nor is it an emotional basket case. Though it may seem both at times, love far transcends our understanding by only understanding the heart. Where we get tripped up with appearances and technicalities, love sees straight through and addresses the essence of the matter. It has no respect for artificial constraints, as it doesn’t need them to understand the world around it better. Love is Jesus’ Spirit still walking the earth continuing the work He started thousands of years ago. Now, He works through <em>us</em>. However, it makes it easier if we lovingly give in to Him. <em>Dare we risk an end like Jesus, Stephen or Bartholomew, giving ourselves to a love that believes all things?</em></p>

          <h2><a href="/father-sized-wound/">father-sized wound</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p><strong>Father-sized wound</strong>. That’s how each of us leaves our parents’ houses. No matter how great our dads were throughout our formative years, they’re not perfect and they were never meant to be. Our dads were only ever meant to be a human metaphor for God the Father. The fact is that we desperately need a Father and depending on our individual fathers, or lack thereof, we will have problems understanding who He is.</p>

<p>I just finished reading <a href="http://donmilleris.com/books/">“Father Fiction” by Donald Miller</a>. I didn’t think I’d find much as my dad was around for most of my childhood, though he spent long hours at the office starting a business. Regardless, the book (an easy read even for me) rocked my world to the very foundations. It helped me understand that my own understanding of God, especially my difficulty in doing so is directly correlated to my childhood experiences with my dad.</p>

<p><strong>“You weren’t loved enough when you were little.”</strong> Yes, that was a quote from Talladega Nights, but seriously, the book allowed me to make a very direct connection between my youth and who I am right now. Honestly, if you know me at all, you realize I have a problem with authority. I’m not brazen enough to challenge it outspokenly, but I will quietly rebel and often. I don’t trust authority. I believe that trust was negatively reinforced when I was young and I never made a positive connection.</p>

<p><strong>Submission remission.</strong> When I first recall my parents, my dad was the law giver, disciplining me I don’t remember what I got in trouble for or the punishment. No, what’s stuck with me was what I didn’t get. After I’d been sent to my room and I had calmed down my sobbing, I went back downstairs to get a hug from my dad. Upon sight, I was yelled at and the connection had been made. What I was seeking was not an escape from punishment, but a reinforcement that my parents, particularly my dad, still loved me. Instead, what I took away was that he was upset.</p>

<p><strong>God doesn’t punish in love.</strong> That’s what I took into college and now today. Therefore, I don’t trust that authority in general is my benefactor, but just a set of laws that someone will yell at you for breaking. And guess what, I’m a relatively well adjusted person for my age and I know it. Even so, I’m deeply screwed up. What should that say?</p>

<p><strong>It’s no one’s fault.</strong> The solution here doesn’t begin with blaming our parents, because I honestly believe they did what they knew at the time was best. In all likelihood, they were trying to correct the mistakes of their fathers and did a humanly job of it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To my own parents, I say, “Thank you both for everything. It was more than I could have asked. Words cannot express how fortunate I feel to have had you and have you now.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>It takes a village to raise a child, but a community to raise an adult.</strong> This is the only way forward. Immersing ourselves completely in community filled with people of all ages. We need elders to help usher us into maturity and wholeness. We need peers to wade through the marshes hand in hand and we need those younger to learn to care for and well. If any component of this is missing, a part of us most likely is as well.</p>

<p>Reader and friend, please consider this a conversation begun. We are all human, therefore we’re broken vessels in need of a Healer. We are all fish out of water, but the water we truly need is that of a different kind. We can continue in our doomed state, or we can begin repairing this void within us. They may look different, but we all have it. I’ve shared a little what mine looks like, but what about yours? Do you even know it’s there? <em>Regardless of your knowledge, it is and it’s a Father-sized wound</em>.</p>

            <p><strong>Love bears all things</strong>. I’ve got my limits as we all do. I’m a forgiving person, but there are certain lines in my mind that you <em>don’t</em> cross. I’m sure you are similar and have different standards for family, friends, significant others, colleagues, etc. Once that line is crossed, it’s war and all bets are off. OK, maybe it’s not so drastic, but that relationship is effectively ended at that very moment. And up to this point, we’re perfectly justified as <a href="http://104.193.143.57/~waywar13/ce/2012/01/12/love-is-patient/" title="Love Is Patient">Love is patient</a>, <a href="http://104.193.143.57/~waywar13/ce/2012/01/19/love-is-kind/" title="Love Is Kind">love is kind</a>, <a href="http://104.193.143.57/~waywar13/ce/2012/01/26/love-does-not-envy/" title="Love Does Not Envy">love does not envy</a>, <a href="http://104.193.143.57/~waywar13/ce/2012/02/02/love-does-not-boast/" title="Love Does Not Boast">love does not boast</a>, <a href="http://104.193.143.57/~waywar13/ce/2012/02/09/love-is-not-arrogant/" title="Love Is Not Arrogant">love is not arrogant</a>, <a href="http://104.193.143.57/~waywar13/ce/2012/02/16/love-is-not-rude/" title="Love Is Not Rude">love is not rude</a>. <a href="http://104.193.143.57/~waywar13/ce/2012/02/23/love-does-not-insist-on-its-own-way/" title="Love Does Not Insist On Its Own Way">Love does not insist on its own way</a>, <a href="http://104.193.143.57/~waywar13/ce/2012/03/01/love-is-not-irritable/" title="Love Is Not Irritable">love is not irritable</a>, <a href="http://104.193.143.57/~waywar13/ce/2012/03/08/love-is-not-resentful/" title="Love Is Not Resentful">love is not resentful</a>, <a href="http://104.193.143.57/~waywar13/ce/2012/03/15/love-does-not-rejoice-at-wrongdoing/" title="Love Does Not Rejoice At Wrongdoing">love does not rejoice at wrongdoing</a> and <a href="http://104.193.143.57/~waywar13/ce/2012/03/22/love-rejoices-with-the-truth/" title="Love Rejoices With the Truth">love rejoices with the truth</a>. However, love also bears all things and once again we’re left to examine our hearts.</p>

<p><strong>Love sent His Son to the cross.</strong> Not having children of my own, I cannot imagine what that felt like, but I can’t imagine anything tougher to bear. Yet, God not only <em>didn’t</em> smite the people responsible, but He began sending out the disciples so that those very people might be <em>reconciled</em> to Him. I think this is the part of the Easter story we miss. God sent His Son as a perfect sacrifice and once the sacrifice had been made and Jesus had risen again, He sent out the disciples to spread the news of salvation. <em>Love bears all things</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Love forgives grievances 70x7.</strong> If someone sins against you that many times (a very large number wrought with Biblical symbolism), you are still to forgive them. We are to forgive in the way that God forgave us at the cross and He forgives us daily. What sin is too great that forgiveness does not wash it white again? What have you or someone else done that forgiveness, which is from God, is not enough? There is one thing God cannot forgive, but that is because blaspheming the Holy Spirit is to deny forgiveness its very source; it is a rejection of its very principle. Ephesians 4:32 has the terms of our forgiveness right there in plain sight. You’ll notice that it has no terms. <em>Love bears all things</em>.</p>

<p>We are only human, but love is divine. Therefore, our love does not cover a subset of trespasses, but <em>all</em>. It is our flawed humanity that tries to keep love from the endless pastures in which it was meant to roam forever. Just because we may not choose to continue to pursue a relationship after a certain set of conditions (which can be wise) doesn’t mean our love was designed to ever follow suit. Our love we cannot tame, cannot corral as it is greater than us. It is our responsibility to simply let it be. The only thing that may overwhelm us is how greatly God works through that love. Is that bad? No, <em>love bears all things</em>.</p>

          <h2><a href="/two-truths-and-a-lie/">two truths and a lie</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p><em>Two truths and a lie</em>. I’m sure most of you remember playing this game as a kid or even as an adult. Maybe you’re better than I am at understanding people you don’t know, but my experience with the game tells me that it’s often quite difficult to discern the lie from the truths. Really, that’s the point of the game. Sadly, this is the game Hollywood has been playing with our hearts and expectations for the past several decades. I just watched <em>No Strings Attached</em> and I’m still trying to process my thoughts, but here’s the unedited knee-jerk reaction.</p>

<p><strong>Like finding a needle in a haystack.</strong> This is the point of the lie in the game. However, we’ve been unwittingly convinced that love begins from a physical connection. In other words, the beginning has to stem from “the spark”. I’m here to tell you I’ve felt the spark and I’m single as the number one today. The spark means nothing. The very concept is conjured up for the sake of planting butts in seats. Also, “the spark” isn’t something that happens in between the sheets. Yes, I’ve been there too, and the only place that leads is heartbreak and divorce. Just ask the 56% of marriages today (I was quoted this statistic in church this past Sunday). No, I don’t hate Hollywood. In fact, I love movies, but I hate the expectation of love that seems to follow from an over-exposure to the ideals espoused in the movies and media today.</p>

<p><strong>Bring on the truth.</strong> To be honest, I love romantic comedies (something I can attribute to my dear mother and sister). I’m not trying to rain down a torrent of hate on this movie’s parade. In fact, there’s one solid piece of truth here. That piece lies in the fact that at some point <em>we have to grow up</em>. There comes a time when we have to get real and make a commitment. In the case of this movie, that came after an extended period of hooking up purely for sex, but that’s for another post. The fact is, we’re all looking for people who can commit. People who cannot commit are not only unattractive, but they’re, well, damaged. And this applies to more than just dating relationships and marriage. Think about it, are you a person who can commit? If not, why?</p>

<p><strong>Sex is more than we know</strong> The fact is that sex, unlike what many of us have come to believe, is only a small percentage physical. The majority of its effects lie in the emotional and the spiritual. I want to focus on the emotional here. You cannot remove that aspect from the act. The emotional tie can be frayed very badly over time, but it is not broken. This is what we do, however, when we think casual flings a way of life. We cover the initial wound(s) we’re nursing with more and more wounds until we can no longer feel because we’re so covered in emotional wounds that we don’t know which is real and what we’ve created in our masochistic nosedive. And we wonder why when we meet the “one” that we have issues with intimacy and commitment. It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure it out, friends. <em>Then we wonder why our relationship with God’s also shallow and meaningless</em>…</p>

<p>While Hollywood is <em>not</em> the root of all evil, they’ve become excellent at telling us what we want to hear. In this case, it seems a validation of our physical needs manifesting themselves in casual hookups. This is not how mature, healthy human adults act and it’s not a lie we need to promote. Instead, we need to allow ourselves to become mature, healthy adults. We need to rid ourselves of our personal baggage, whatever that is, seeking out help to do so and only then can we attempt to take on another’s issues, confronting two sets of problems as two whole adults. Otherwise, you’re merely handicapping yourself and this fight doesn’t need to be any harder. Finally, sex is not a toy. Yes, I know what I just said and yes, that is precisely what I meant. We treat it as worthless, washable, fixable, etc. just like our favorite t-shirt. This isn’t how it works and was never to be this way. Sex is consuming physically, emotionally and spiritually and it’s time we treated it as such. This is why sex was originally designed to be enjoyed within the context of marriage. However, this is why so few marriages stay as such today. So, <em>will we be able to pick out the lie today as we’re playing this game of two truths and a lie</em>?</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p>Love rejoices with the truth. <a href="http://wp.me/p1iTRz-gl">Last week</a>, I highlighted love’s not rejoicing in wrongdoing. For those of you following along, it seems like I’m about to blog about the same topic and you’re right. However, the fact that this line is also included in the text should prompt us to investigate it. Does it merely restate the aforementioned or does it speak something different? The long and the short of it that this phrase does both.</p>

<p><strong>Love more than rejects.</strong> You see, love doesn’t stop at rejecting wrongdoing, it goes a step further than that and actively seeks truth. This extra step is where I see us falling short. It is one thing to reject the wrong, but a whole other then to replace that with truth in our lives. To be honest, I’ve heard this multiple times reiterated with a slightly different syntax each time, but its real meaning still is fuzzy to me. Maybe, (I could be totally off here) we don’t understand correctly what truth is in this context.</p>

<p><strong>Truth has no context.</strong> Sorry, I set us both up for that. However, this is the crux of truth. You may counter with “facts” such as the world is flat, Pluto being a planet, the earth being at the center of the universe, etc. and you are right in each case. This is not what I’m arguing. We are talking about apples and oranges comparing theories and natural laws with truth. Truth, as referred to in 1 Corinthians 13:6, is the set of immutable facts of the universe. If you’ve spent more than 5 minutes on this planet, you know that nothing on earth is immutable and you’re probably aware that fact holds true for the rest of the universe. However, there is one thing, and only one, that does not change. That is God. The truth in which our souls delight is God and God alone. So what does this look like?</p>

<p><strong>It’s a return to the Garden.</strong> Rejoicing in truth is returning to a time when what delighted Adam and Eve most was learning more and more about God and glorifying Him. Truth is God’s word. Truth is worship. Truth is fellowship. Truth is prayer. Rejoicing in truth is savoring each and every moment we are able to partake in any one of these privileges. It’s understanding that each is a privilege in which we shouldn’t be allowed to partake. Rejoicing in the truth is fighting for more time every day because our souls cannot get enough. It is realizing that God is greater than all else, including the gifts with which He lavishes on us.</p>

<p>Love is not content with rejecting ugliness, but seeks actively to create beauty in its wake. It does not rest in the void. Love seeks what is worthwhile and is glad in its purity. That purity is truth and it was, is and will always be just that. Truth should not be confused with theory or law as truth is about an unchanging God and is therefore itself unchanging. Truth ushers us back toward the Garden, reminding us of perfection that we once knew. Truth reunites us with our Love and fortifies us in a blessed fellowship caught up lovingly in His infinite arms against the nuclear ones of the world. Truth secures us in the one place that cannot be shaken so that we will be proved on that Day. <em>A whole heart knows that love rejoices with the truth</em>.</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p><em>Change the world</em>. You heard me. Go out and do it. This is something that I have come to realize from reading <a href="http://donmilleris.com/2012/03/13/you-can-change-the-world-what-i-learned-from-pete-carroll/">Donald Miller’s blog</a> this past week. I’m hoping you’ve read that by this point, otherwise the rest of this post will be me blabbering on in futility. Let’s face it, each of us has a significant purpose and it’s up to us to leverage it and milk it for all of God’s glory that it’s worth.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask God, who gives generously to all without reproach, and it will be given him. But let him ask in faith, with no doubting, for the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea that is driven and tossed by the wind.” — James 1:5–6</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>You gotta ask.</strong> If we want anything from God, including finding our life’s purpose, we have to ask for it. It’s just that simple. However, we don’t just ask once, but we have to be diligent. We have to be earnest in our desire. If we seek to understand God’s plan for our lives, He will not disappoint. Friends, we will not be left wanting. Do we know that? Do we believe that with everything in us? Before we can move forward, we must. There is no alternative.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“‘Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks it will be opened. Or which one of you, if his son asks him for bread, will give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a serpent? If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him!’” — Matthew 7:7–11</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>We need to know how to receive.</strong> OK, we’ve established that upon seeking the heart of God, He will provide. But, here’s the next critical step in this process: <em>we need to listen</em>. This is particularly difficult for someone so internally rambunctious as myself. For a culture that is so bent on perpetual busyness and noise, this is nigh impossible. We have to fight everything our culture teaches us here and allow for a break in the hustle and bustle. We have to quiet our hearts and be receptive. Contrary to popular belief, this is just as active as any other action we perform. It’s merely a more subtle form of action. Yes, listening is active. However, the story doesn’t stop here.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“So, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.” — I Corinthians 10:31</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Do it now.</strong> My dad has this in his office and I think there is a lot to this phrase, especially in this context. Once we hear from God, we have to get moving. We need to be prepared to make moves and follow where He leads. Guess what, it won’t be easy.However, if we’re not ready to follow, then what’s the purpose in asking the question to begin with? Here’s the kicker (especially in my case): our action requires perseverance and follow through. We can’t just start and stop midway through once we can no longer evidently see the progress we’re making toward our goal. Instead, that is precisely the time to renew our purpose. Can you make that commitment? Once again, we must.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“For we are the aroma of Christ to God among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing, to one a fragrance from death to death, to the other a fragrance from life to life.” — II Corinthians 2:15–16a</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Everyday, the choice is ours. We can choose to believe that God has created us to change the world, or we can continue with the status quo. We can live a life worth living or we can subsist. It begins with our asking. We first have to approach the throne of God with confidence and ask expecting an answer. It continues with actively waiting and listening for His response. It’s tough because it doesn’t feel active, but we have to continuously tell ourselves that it in fact is active. Finally, we have to act on our answer. Follow through is key and absolutely necessary if we are to do anything with our lives at all. God made us for great purposes, <em>so let’s change the world and now</em>.</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p><em>Love does not rejoice at wrongdoing</em>. I have to confess, <em>I don’t like this series</em>. Each week, I read for the next attribute of love and each week I’m confronted by my shortcomings. This week is no different, only my outlook. I would tell you about the countless times I’ve taken delight in things unfitting of a child of God, but it’s easier to let you think up your own stories and just insert my name into most of them. I think they’d be at least 80% true. Instead, I’ll take this brief moment to note that in confronting this darkness in our souls, there is discomfort and pain. I won’t sugarcoat this, not for an instant. I agree we are far more fallen than we’d like to believe and will continue to recognize that daily. However, the pain is fleeting and then we are left with the fruit of our diligence in following our gracious and merciful God. It is then that we remember just how greatly He loves us and forget whatever preluded that bliss. With that in mind, let us delve into our unrighteousness head on.</p>

<p><strong>We delight in evil.</strong> There’s something so dark and sinister about those four letters as to make them wholly unpalatable to the lofty ideas I maintain of my faith. Yet, when we get down to it, all that falls short of God’s glory is just that, evil. You may be disagreeing with me right now, but take this moment to inventory the things you enjoy: the jokes, stories, movies, pastimes, etc. Now tell me, was it all wholesome? Yes, friend, that was a rhetorical question. I’m not here to tell you what to enjoy as I’m in no position to do so given each of the categories listed above. I’m just pointing out that we all have our habits.</p>

<p><strong>I sense a reticence.</strong> At this point, knowing my own heart I know that some of you may have stopped reading at the last paragraph and others are about to stop reading right now, but hold on. This post is not meant for behavior adjustment. While that may happen as a result, this post is meant to reignite or fan the flame of a soul meant to burn uncontrollably for God. However, that can only happen when we remove the chaff from our hearts that serves only to suffocate and kill.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“After this many of his disciples turned back and no longer walked with him. So Jesus said to the Twelve, ‘Do you want to go away as well?’ Simon Peter answered him, ‘Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life, and we have believed, and have come to know, that you are the Holy One of God.’” -John 6:66–69</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Where do we turn?</strong> That’s the question we should be asking ourselves right now. I think we all know we’re supposed to turn away from evil yada yada. But what I feel is less obvious is the corollary to that. Obviously I struggle here too, but I will take a stab (no Easter pun intended) at it and see what you think. We turn to the Word. We turn to each other. Alone and together we pray. We pray like our hearts last hope is in our cries out to God, because believe it or not they are. Everyday, we run the risk of losing our heart to this cancer. Don’t forget this part: we rejoice. We rejoice in the victory already won. We rejoice in the salvation bought for our souls once for all at Calvary. We rejoice in a war won nearly two thousand years ago despite a sore loser. We rejoice in a God evermore greater than any snare. We rejoice because we have nowhere else to go.</p>

<p><strong>Pray fervently. Rejoice like it’s your job.</strong></p>

          <h2><a href="/friends-will-change-you/">friends will change you</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p><em>Friends will change you</em>. I spent this past weekend up in New York celebrating a good friend’s birthday. It’s hard not to walk away from a weekend spent almost entirely with two other people feeling a little closer. Inevitably, this weekend like every other had to leave and I faced an arduous four-and-a-half hour drive to make it back in time for church, more importantly a membership class that I can’t miss again. During the drive I was reminded of my conversation a month ago with Erik, the recent birthday boy. The words, <a href="http://104.193.143.57/~waywar13/ce/2012/02/13/what-if-you-dont-find-it/" title="What If You Don’t Find It?">“What if you don’t find it?”</a> still ringing in my head, especially in the context of the past forty-eight hours. And I realized I’ll never find another Erik or Jon and I no longer want to.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“His divine power has granted to us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of him who called us to his own glory and excellence, by which he has granted to us his precious and very great promises, so that through them you may become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped from the corruption that is in the world because of sinful desire.” — II Peter 1:3–4</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Batteries not included.</strong> You’re not seeing that phrase in this passage, because God doesn’t give things like that to us. When it says He’s given us everything that pertain to life and godliness, it means <em>everything</em>. Don’t you think that one of the paramount gifts is friends? With as many exhortations to be and stay in community, it’s far from believable that God would leave us high and dry on the issue of friends. Before we were born, God provided us with all the friends and all the right friends we would ever need. While I’m not advocating going into our shells and neglecting to meet another person for the rest of our lives, our focus in regards to our best friends will probably be different. I believe that most likely these people are already in our lives and our pursuit isn’t necessarily for more friends, but deeper friendships. Deeper friendships. In other words, it’s a question of stewardship. Are we fully using our friendships for God’s glory or are we just squandering them? There’s no third option.</p>

<p><strong>How do you view God?</strong> It’s the question at the heart of the matter. If we truly viewed God as the good and perfect provider, then passages like the one above would merely be a good reminder of the life we’re already living. We’d know that the friendships we have are sufficient and looking to deepen them constantly. If we viewed God as His name explicitly defines, the most important being in the universe, then we’d never think twice and we’d already be using every interaction with our friends to His glory. I don’t know you (most likely), but you don’t. Neither of those views do you hold. Look down into your heart and you’ll have to agree on some level if not completely. I’ll admit I don’t, but I’m certainly aware now.</p>

<p><strong>Where is your doctrine?</strong> Yes, I’m asking about your theology here. The place to start rectifying this problem is with what you believe about God. If you spend time understanding God for who He is as Provider and the Alpha and Omega, then there is little stopping you, but they key to stewardship and right relationships is just this understanding. The key, in other words, is our motivation. Then, it is a matter of sticking with our friends and putting in the hard work that brings joy greater than all the heartbreak in the world. That’s right. This is the way God designed relationships so that we could learn through pain and be drawn back in by the overwhelming joy when we get things right. This is what keeps us coming back for more.</p>

<p>Friendships are that important. Without them, we are living half a life. Without relationships, deep relationships, we can live a surface level existence merely floating along. We have to dive deeper into our faith in God. We have to allow for Him to be who He is and says He is. Then, also, can we dive deeper into our friendships and enjoy them fully for the gift they are. Dare I say there is nothing so great on this earth as those? Friends will change you.</p>

          <h2><a href="/love-is-not-resentful/">love is not resentful</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p><em>Love is not resentful</em>. Holding grudges is so 90s. Who really has the time for that? Especially with how busy everyone is, where is the time or the energy to waste on silly junk like that? These are a sampling of my reaction to this phrase. I’ve never been one to hold a grudge. Instead, I’ve always been more of a pushover letting people get away with more than I ought to have. However, just yesterday it came to my attention. Not just one rock, but a whole cargo plane-full of rocks was dumped on my glass house and oh did it shatter. What I found in the rubble was ignoring is far from not resenting.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Be angry and do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your anger, and give no opportunity to the devil.” — Ephesians 4:26–27</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Resentment is a bitter weed.</strong> I was going for herb, but the truth of the matter is resentment is nothing but a treacherous weed that takes root in the soul and begins wrapping its complicated system of roots around our hearts and slowly but surely suffocating them. What makes resentment so dangerous is that it’s a passive aggressive reaction. It isn’t quite as bold as anger, but like a leak in a dam, builds over time and it’s nearly too late when you do finally notice it. Resentment is a defense mechanism that slowly works its way into our psyche fertilized by past hurt(s) and time. Time is what really allows the mechanism to armor itself and harden our hearts against similar hurts, but really shuts us off to our loved ones and future friends, acquaintances, etc.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Therefore, confess your sins to one another and pray for one another, that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous person has great power as it is working.” — James 5:16</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>This is a team sport.</strong> There is only one way to avoid this and it is simply to be open and honest with one another about the dirty laundry we all have. This means we have to take the time to <em>slow down</em> and roll up our sleeves with one another. I think we can all agree that there’s a lot to muck through in this life and we don’t need to make it any harder on ourselves. It’s a two step process involving both <em>confession</em> and <em>forgiveness</em>. We have to both come to others when we’ve wronged them and be quick to remember God’s forgiveness of our wrongs when others have mistreated us. We need to let other people in to help and also to better enable us to help ourselves. How else is this going to get done? There is no one that will do this for us, so it’s up to us to initiate this process. Come on, there isn’t any more time to waste.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Put on then, as God’s chosen ones, holy and beloved, compassionate hearts, kindness, humility, meekness, and patience, bearing with one another and, if one has a complaint against another, forgiving each other; as the Lord has forgiven you, so you also must forgive.” — Colossians 3:12–13</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Transparency and honesty are scary things, but aren’t the less scary than waking up an old, bitter hermit? Isn’t the potential of getting hurt a few times, but also experiencing giving and receiving true love far outweigh never opening ourselves up to such a possibility? These are the questions we have to ask ourselves and today. These are the questions we have been avoiding, but by avoiding we are merely choosing without giving any option. Is this what we want, <em>or wouldn’t we rather love as it’s not resentful</em>?</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p>Live deliberately. Yep, that’s all I’ve got for you. Two words. Alright, let’s move on with our lives.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>1. carefully weighed or considered; studied; intentional<br />
2. careful or slow in deciding<br />
3. leisurely and steady in movement or action; slow and even; unhurried</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>This isn’t going to be simple.</strong> I needed to get that out of the way right now. There’s a lot that wrapped up in this two word admonishment that’s come up for me a few times in the last week. First of all, after looking it up deliberate is <em>not</em> resolve as I’d pictured in my mind, it’s far more. Deliberate is <em>understanding</em> what makes up their moral compass and then <em>slowly</em> and <em>intentionally</em> measuring other thoughts, actions, etc. against that compass and moving forward with <em>resolve</em> based on the judgment. Deliberate is <em>confronting</em> our lifestyle of information overload and <em>extracting</em> only what we need to be informed, <em>rejecting</em> the urge to stick our heads in the sand.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect.” — Romans 12:2</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>We have to understand.</strong> Primarily what I mean by this is we need to understand our faith and <em>deeply</em>. We need to <em>inspect</em> it and <em>challenge</em> it one article at a time until we have a faith that is wholly ours and no longer borrowed from friends, family or others. Without this critical step of ownership, then we are like a foundation built on sand, ripe for erosion, flooding and all other sorts of disaster. Also important is an understanding of the world around us. If we do not understand our surroundings, how can we apply the principles of our faith to our lives at all, let alone effectively? No, we must understand our world, too.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Therefore, preparing your minds for action, and being sober-minded, set your hope fully on the grace that will be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ. As obedient children, do not be conformed to the passions of your former ignorance, but as he who called you is holy, you also be holy in all your conduct, since it is written, ‘You shall be holy, for I am holy.’” — I Peter 1:13–16</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Slow down.</strong> We need to be comfortable with stepping back, taking our time and evaluating what is happening around us. We need to be comfortable with the fact that the earth doesn’t spin any faster today than it did two thousand years ago and whatever we may miss in those precious moments can be caught up on with a simple text, email or phone call. Really, we need to understand that <em>in slowing down, we aren’t missing anything</em> but rather taking more in. And what we take in will undoubtedly be more important. Isn’t that what truly matters? Isn’t that the way to survive the age of information overload?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I have been crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me. And the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.” — Galatians 2:20</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Stop completely.</strong> You heard me. You’re doing it all wrong, now step back. After all, we’re human and prone to error. God isn’t. He isn’t human, nor is He prone to error. Let Him take control. Allow Him the rightful place in Your life He should have had all along. How else can we turn our wisdom and deliberation into perfectly directed action? I know I cannot and I suspect you have a similar story. We’re not going to conquer the world, heck, I can’t even conquer the faucet in my shower. The only way to achieve the follow through we desire, that stands out among the stinking heaps of aimless relativism is allowing God to step in. Allowing the One who orchestrates every molecule, atom and quark to the beauty of his glory. What do you think He could do with your life?</p>

<p><strong>Stop, drop and roll.</strong> The deliberate life looks kind of like a person who’s caught fire. Isn’t that fitting, though? We stop to understand our faith and world, then evaluate what’s happening around us. We drop all that we’re trying so hard to carry along the way and trust God to bring all that is necessary. Then, like a Duracell bunny tumbleweed, <em>we roll</em>. There is nothing that can stop us, nothing once we give our lives completely over to God that can stand in our way. There is nothing more dangerous and benign at the same time as someone living the deliberate life. All at once, they have nothing to lose, yet they are filled with the unconditional love of God. So, what do you have to lose? The better question is what don’t you have to gain? <em>Live deliberately</em>.</p>

          <h2><a href="/love-is-not-irritable/">love is not irritable</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p><em>Love isn’t irritable</em>. This week, the topic cut straight through my thick prideful shell like a freshly sharpened paring knife through a plastic grocery bag. I’m not an openly angry person, but I’m quite apt to become irritable. I’m irritable at least twice a day, commuting in either direction to or from work. Yes, traffic irritates me. More pertinently, people who ask for help and remain an air of stubbornness also irritate me. I guarantee you have your hot buttons as well because we’re human, we all do.</p>

<p><strong>It’s a matter of expectation.</strong> When I look at my own irritability, I realize it stems primarily from my own expectations going unmet. When I try to do something for someone ( i.e., help them), I expect the process to take the course that I want it to. I want things to go smoothly and I want them to openly accept my help. So you see, I apparently get irritated every time I try to help someone. I’m laughing at myself right now, but now it’s time to turn the mirror back on you. I think if you earnestly ask the question, you’ll find a similar answer. And beneath that, we find that this irritability stems from a source of self service.</p>

<p><strong>Who are we loving?</strong> Am I really loving the other person or am I reflexively attempting to bring myself some love? I feel like I’m beating a dead horse, but truth is we have a question of motive. If we were to love for love’s sake, irritability would not be an issue. It’s Lent, so we look to the last forty days of Jesus’ life and see that this is precisely what He was espousing. As we’re approaching Easter, let’s not forget that Jesus knew what was to come as He prepared His disciples and Himself for the greatest love sacrifice the world has ever seen. This is our great example.</p>

<p><strong>Our recourse is simple.</strong> However, the simplest solutions are always the hardest. When we begin to get irritated, that is the moment we need to step back. We need to ask ourselves the question in the spur of the moment and figure out where our expectations have led us off track. If we can do this, we can beat back the irritation and love more fully.</p>

<p>Despite our natures (or at least mine), irritability does not have to be inevitable. We all have expectations and we cannot change that fact. However, when those expectations are rooted in things like pride and false truths, that is how expectations can serve to produce irritability and fast. Let’s not just settle to mask our irritability, but confront it at its core. Though we are prone to it, <em>God gave us love and it is not irritable</em>.</p>

          <h2><a href="/why-do-we-keep-dying/">why do we keep dying?</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p><em>Why do we keep dying</em>? That’s what I imagine non-Christians ask who hang out around groups of Christians for any period of time. No, I’m not saying we’re all zombies, half-dead but refusing to submit to our mortality. Not quite at least. Have you ever stopped to think how much we invoke the phrase “die to self” or other images of death? The casual observer must think we’re all necrophiliacs or something, always talking about death. I’m guilty of this as well.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“What do you think happens when you die?”<br />
“I don’t know. Maybe I turn into a ghost or something.”<br />
“That sounds sad.”<br />
“Why? What do you think?”<br />
“Well, I believe in Jesus so I know I’ll be in heaven forever.”<br />
*Long pregnant pause*<br />
“Do you always think about death?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>“Do you always think about death?”</strong> I think that’s a question we need to ask ourselves. It’s easy to get caught with our eyes fixed on the cross, the Roman device of choice for public torture. It is only the <em>symbol</em> of Christianity. Just because it’s the symbol, it doesn’t make it everything. It seems however that we’ve latched onto this half of the story and we’ve tried our best to make it socially appealing. I hate to be the one to break the bad news, but it’s <em>death</em>. Death was never meant to be sexy or cool. Death is ugly, morbid and grotesque. Death is what it is and we need to accept it for that fact. It is necessary in our faith as it is also a fact of this life, but was never meant to be the lynchpin.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we shall certainly be united with him in a resurrection like his. We know that our old self was crucified with him in order that the body of sin might be brought to nothing, so that we would no longer be enslaved to sin. For one who has died has been set free from sin. Now if we have died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him. We know that Christ, being raised from the dead, will never die again; death no longer has dominion over him. For the death he died he died to sin, once for all, but the life he lives he lives to God. So you also must consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus. “ — Romans 6:5–10</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>It’s for freedom we’ve been freed.</strong> We have life in Christ so that we might <em>live</em> it. Death is the antithesis of life. We can spend our days focusing on death, or we can be giving life to those around us. Doesn’t that even sound better? We are called to let the dead bury their own, but we contradict this when we are so consumed in death. In doing this, we serve to waste the life we’ve been given, but not guaranteed. Our actions show instead that we take it for granted and serve only to invalidate the gift.</p>

<p><strong>There is wisdom in death.</strong> We know death so that we can fully appreciate the gift of life. We know death so that we might have a right view of God and the healthy fear that is inherent in understanding this stark contrast. We are not to cast aside death as to do so would be to embrace it fully (think about that for a second). Instead, with death in the back of our minds, we are called to pursue life and this is the balance we are to strive for in this existence. This is the vitality that God grants us.</p>

<p>With death on our heals, should we not run all the faster toward life? Instead we slothfully dawdle as if life waits on <em>us</em>. We have only so much time on this earth and yet we waste much of it. We who were running so well, what has slowed us? Have our muscles grown tired, our shoes worn out? If God took perfect care of the wayward Israelites in the desert for forty years, will He not do much the same for us? It’s time to break free from the death which we hold onto so tightly and resume our fervent pursuit of life. Isn’t life what we’re really desiring in the depths of our hearts? Then why do we keep dying?</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p><em>Love does not insist on its own way</em>. So far in this weekly series on love, we’ve found it to be <a href="http://104.193.143.57/~waywar13/ce/2012/01/12/love-is-patient/" title="Love Is Patient">patient</a> and <a href="http://104.193.143.57/~waywar13/ce/2012/01/19/love-is-kind/" title="Love Is Kind">kind</a>, but <a href="http://104.193.143.57/~waywar13/ce/2012/01/26/love-does-not-envy/" title="Love Does Not Envy">not envious</a>, <a href="http://104.193.143.57/~waywar13/ce/2012/02/02/love-does-not-boast/" title="Love Does Not Boast">boastful</a>, <a href="http://104.193.143.57/~waywar13/ce/2012/02/09/love-is-not-arrogant/" title="Love Is Not Arrogant">arrogant</a> or <a href="http://104.193.143.57/~waywar13/ce/2012/02/16/love-is-not-rude/" title="Love Is Not Rude">rude</a>. Each week has stretched my understanding as I hope it has for you. I think as with each week, the topic seems simple enough. Love doesn’t insist on its own way. It’s straightforward; an open and shut case. Yes, but really no. There is a right way and a wrong way to love as I hope we’ve established by now, but this time we aim a little bigger with our sights.</p>

<p><strong>Love isn’t one size fits all.</strong> We’ve all grown up learning to love everyone and treat everyone equally. I could not agree with this more, but we’ve taken this a step too far. We all look different, act differently, think differently and carry on our relationships with God differently, correct? Then, it’s safe to say that we are all different physically, mentally, emotionally, spiritually and love sets out to care for each of these dynamics of our beings. With that in mind, how can we try to love everyone in the same way, as in with the same tactics and methodology? It’s like taking a mandolin to a metal concert. Sure, you can play it well, but it is far from applying and it just sounds terrible. This is a major problem. We wonder why people in the Church are leaving or maladjusted. Sure, we’re loving on the person, but they are not being loved in their innermost being. Is it really caring for the person, or is it plain ignorance?</p>

<p>There’s not much here to say. It’s plain and simple: we’re not loving people the way they deserve and need to be loved. It’s time we stopped and took a moment to understand our friends, loved ones and neighbors. It’s time we got to know who the people around us truly are and give them the kind of love that Jesus so freely grants us, a love that meets us where we are. But first, we need to treat everyone equally and decide to love them right. It is a war, especially when love doesn’t insist on its own way.</p>

          <h2><a href="/the-gospel-of-enough/">the gospel of enough</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p><em>The Gospel of enough is what we follow</em>. That is in theory, of course. If you’ve observed human nature for more than three seconds, you’d know that this doesn’t hold its weight in water. I find I spend each day thinking about, planning and conspiring how to get more and more. This is just how we are wired, or maybe it’s just me, but I’m highly doubtful of this possibility. So then, why do I say we follow the Gospel of enough?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Sheol and Abaddon are never satisfied, and never satisfied are the eyes of man.” –Proverbs 27:20</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>There’s a huge disconnect.</strong> We have this Gospel that I claim is about having enough, but within the Bible itself, it recognizes man is never satisfied. This seems rather incompatible no matter what angle you approach it. However, the problem isn’t the incompatibility, but rather the misperception. Always wanting more means that if we continue to receive, at some point we will have more than we can handle. Let’s use money in this example and if I literally have more money than I know what to do with, is it not more money than I could really want? It is certainly more than I could need and herein lies the misperception. Always having more is the lie we’ve bought. We don’t always want more, because at some point we are no longer able to enjoy it. We first have to understand this fact.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Enough is not only as good as a feast, but is all that the greatest glutton can truly enjoy. This is all that we should expect; a craving for more than this is ungrateful.” –Spurgeon “Morning and Evening”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Enough is all we could want.</strong> Really, we want in the pursuit of enjoyment, but with all things we reach a threshold and are no longer able to enjoy. God knew this from the beginning and thus each day gives us our daily bread. He grants us enough strength, mercy, grace, etc. to last us through the day, but no more. Even more certainly, it will last no less than the fullness of that day. The moment we wake, the Spirit is poured into us so as to fill us up for the day’s events (trials, glories et al.) Any more and we would not be able to withstand it. One iota more and we would be overwhelmed by the excess and less, we would be forsaken.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“For truly, I say to you, if you have faith like a grain of mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move, and nothing will be impossible for you.” — Matthew 17:20b-21</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Enough is more.</strong> I believe part of the meaning of Jesus’ words here have every bit to do with this matter of enough. The disciples were asking for more faith and Jesus’ retort seems to point them in another direction. In these words I hear Him saying that they had already been given enough faith, but that it was up to them to realize that enough was what they truly needed and desired. Christ here takes the lie and turns it on its head. He is saying that more is less and enough is more. The men walking daily with Jesus only needed the faith the size of the smallest known seed at the time, I doubt the size of the faith was the real issue.</p>

<p><strong>This is the beauty of the Gospel.</strong> It provides an end to our otherwise unceasing striving for more. We are granted rest from the monotony and strain. We are set free from the vanity of more. Yet, in the midst of it all, it promises all we could ever enjoy. No, it is not the gospel of more, because <em>the Gospel of Enough is all that could be asked</em>. Amen.</p>

            <p><em>Love is not rude</em>. This is a tough one to talk about because none of us are rude. Not a single one of us and so to write hypothetically about something like this is simply difficult as I don’t have any tangible experience or examples. But since we’ve already covered that love isn’t <a href="http://104.193.143.57/~waywar13/ce/2012/02/02/love-does-not-boast/" title="Love Does Not Boast">boastful</a> or <a href="http://104.193.143.57/~waywar13/ce/2012/02/09/love-is-not-arrogant/" title="Love Is Not Arrogant">arrogant</a>, let’s get off our high horses and take a look at this.</p>

<p><strong>America is a melting pot.</strong> As such, I have relatives from another country and growing up there was something I had to learn. I knew from a very young age, these people would literally give you the shirt off their back (it almost happened more than once) along with other gifts that they couldn’t afford, but it was their way of showing they loved me (it’s still their way). What I didn’t understand was that at some point, I had to give in. I had to allow them the pleasure of giving. To Not do so was merely rude and disrespectful. Now, you who’ve interacted with other cultures either at home or abroad, have you had a similar situation or a situation where you could see something like this happening even completely unintentionally?</p>

<p><strong>Americans know best.</strong> This is a universal fact. Every good US citizen is fully aware of this as we assert our language and culture all over the world. Friends, this is merely ignorance. There are a few things we’ve gotten right in this country, but we are far from ideal, let alone perfect. Our customs, methods of thinking, worship, translation of the Bible are not the best, nor are they the only out there. To even pretend so is unloving. To force any of these on another is just as unloving.</p>

<p><strong>Ignorance is not an excuse.</strong> No, it is a prison. Understanding is the only way we will be able to love others the way they ought to be. The path to understanding is two-fold, but I’ll warn you it doesn’t happen magically or overnight. First of all, it requires us to seek out information on other cultures. Yes, there is some head knowledge that needs to be acquired in this process. Consider this the research phase. This lays the groundwork where we can understand the fundamentals of other cultures. Then, we need to interact face to face with these cultures. That’s right, we need to once again get up off our lazy butts and actively look for ways to go out of ours (gasp!) so that we can meet other people where they are. Then, we can build on top of the foundation and understand how to love individuals within the given framework of their culture. Friends, is this not what Jesus did? Granted, He is omniscient and can skip step one, but like the woman at the well, He sought to understand her and found a way to love her best. We’re still talking about that encounter today.</p>

<p>Rudeness is merely an impression. It does not take into account intention, but rather effect. Therefore, we cannot claim ignorance as our alibi. It is old and worn and hasn’t functioned since the Crusades (yes, we just went there). Our own country is a melting pot of different cultures, thought, etc. so to learn how to love even our own neighbors, let alone people in other countries, we have to cast aside our preconceptions of haughtiness. There is nothing about us that is better than anyone else. Now that we’ve gotten that out of the way, we can begin to fill that void with knowledge of other cultures and appreciate them on the grander scale. Once we understand customs and general societal issues, we have the framework to begin to love people individually from that given culture. We see the beauty in them that God sees every day. We become the Gospel, but only when we realize <em>love is not rude</em>.</p>

          <h2><a href="/what-if-you-dont-find-it/">what if you don’t find it?</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p><em>“What if you don’t find it?”</em> It’s true that we’re a consumerist nation. Therefore, we’re always looking for the next big thing that will complete us. It was through a conversation with a dear friend Erik who was visiting this weekend that brought this to light for me. He was asking me how my transition was going and I was lamenting the lack of a friend like him in the area. Then, he had the nerve to ask me, “What if you don’t find it?” “Then I’ll keep looking,” was my response, but I knew full well this wasn’t the answer. Over the past day or so I’ve wrestled with this question and realized that I’ve transplanted this consumerism into both my spirituality as well as my relationships. Doing so, I’ll never be happy because there’s always something better out there and I’ll never be able to have it all.</p>

<p><strong>One size doesn’t fit all.</strong> Living in the wealthy pocket of northern Virginia outside D.C., you find a lot of people who have much and are just put together. I think we all have those people in our lives and it’s easy to give into the temptation of trying to emulate what they have because it works <em>so</em> well for them. First of all, I’ve realized it probably isn’t working for them, but let’s give them the benefit of the doubt for argument’s sake. Then, who’s to say that their church, their relationships, their particular relationship with God fits us as well? If it does, you may want to step away from the mirror and stop daydreaming. We’re all made uniquely and have to remember that fact especially in these areas.</p>

<p><strong>Where are you looking?</strong> Assuming that we’ve not started dressing like, talking like and driving the same car as Jimmy or Sally, and we’ve decided we’re missing something crucial in our lives, where do we turn? There’s no supermarket for these needs in our lives. You may find it in church, you may find it at work, or how about while getting gas? Have we narrowed down our search too much? In our search, do we try to tie God’s hands behind His back commanding Him to provide for us in a specific way? Don’t you realize that God is both infinite <em>and</em> good? Therefore, He will not forsake you, but He has <em>billions</em> (maybe more) of ways of providing for you.</p>

<p><strong>Why are you looking?</strong> Here was the shocker for me, but <em>sometimes you already have it</em>. God gives us so much on a regular basis that it’s easy to become desensitized to this fact and overlook the heap of what we already have. This is where the question “What if you don’t find it?” takes us. I don’t want to say that if we don’t find something immediately that this is the obvious answer, but it deserves a thorough examination. Yet, it begs a bigger question that I don’t think many of us are ready to ask.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Can I be content with what I already have?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Shopping and striving for the next great thing come naturally to us. That is the way we were made as Adam and Eve’s fall from grace so demonstrated. In light of that, the human race has spent its time speeding up the rat race of this existence procuring miracle product/relationship/drug after another in a progressively more rapid fashion. What if we stopped to think about what this says about how we view the gifts of God? What if we stopped to think, period? Friends, as I wrote <a href="http://104.193.143.57/~waywar13/ce/2012/02/06/weve-been-given-everything/" title="We’ve Been Given Everything">last week</a> we’ve been given everything for a godly life. In our consumerism, do we merely say it’s not enough? Or are we content where He has led us asking “What if you don’t find it?”</p>

          <h2><a href="/love-is-not-arrogant/">love is not arrogant</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p><em>Love is not arrogant</em>. If you’ve spent any time around Christians, we are a hardheaded bunch, but it is because we are generally a bit arrogant. We love Jesus, therefore our love (all of our loves and pursuits) are blessed by the Lord on high. I am no different as I had to look back at <a href="http://104.193.143.57/~waywar13/ce/2012/02/02/love-does-not-boast/" title="Love Does Not Boast">last week’s post</a> to see if I hadn’t covered this topic already. Even then, it feels like we did. My reaction to this assertion about love is the same and I see little need to talk about this, but the revelation is also much the same. I am the victim of a fallen love in this aspect as well.</p>

<p><strong>My love is better.</strong> If you’ve been reading along, I hope you will have noticed it’s easy to think our love or our ability to love greater at least than average. With respect to arrogance, I have found myself thinking that I was able to love in a way that exceeded that of the common guy. I thought that the trajectory, how I was directing my love, was superior to average Joe, but I never uttered a word of this to anyone. Friends, these are both arrogance. Yes, filthy, stinking arrogance creeping in and rotting an otherwise young and healthy love. On your own, friends, your love is not strong enough to withstand this malady. You will end up with a vegetable for a love, capable of little, pathetic.</p>

<p><strong>Change the world.</strong> This is what we ultimately want from our love, correct? This isn’t possible with a love full of the arrogance virus. Yes, a virus, and when it creeps in, our love cannot grow or mature as we become delusional, thinking our love is purer or stronger or you fill in the blank. I think we can all agree that as a result of being flawed and human (pardon the redundancy), we are all in need of growth and constantly. This is no different for our love. History is chock full of people whose love was sickened by arrogance and the world was changed, but only in the form of death and destruction.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask God, who gives generously to all without reproach, and it will be given him.” — James 1:5</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>We have to find it.</strong> I mean, we don’t, but if we’re interested in being healthy, loving individuals we have no choice. It is the only way forward, but we are not alone. You may have picked up on it earlier, but not being alone is crucial as we cannot overcome this alone, nor are we expected to. In what way are you struggling with arrogance here? Are you frustrated, exasperated, hopeless? How is your prayer life? Often this is the first to go. If the problem does not lie here, do you expect an answer from the Father? Do you expect none? Or do you expect it here and now? Friend, God is willing to help the humble, but He helps those who’ve entrusted Him with their faith and only in His time.</p>

<p>[youtube <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTjmz6lETU&amp;w=560&amp;h=315]">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHTjmz6lETU&amp;w=560&amp;h=315]</a></p>

<p>We’re all in this together, trying to love the best we can, fighting off arrogance. Our love isn’t better, bigger, purer, stronger; no, our love is ordinary. It is sick and in danger, but our Savior is great. God is more than able and to top it off, He is more than willing. We are neither alone, nor are we without hope. However, it will take time. Each day, we are faced with the choice and each day we must choose humility telling ourselves that love is not arrogant.</p>

          <h2><a href="/weve-been-given-everything/">we’ve been given everything</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>We’ve been given everything. All that we need to live a life fitting a believer in Christ. I’m taking a Gospel class at the church I am in the process of joining and there was a statistic that jarred me, albeit only slightly. Of professing evangelicals in this country, over half agreed there was another way to heaven than Jesus. At that moment, my heart began wrenching, but it wasn’t the first time I had heard something like this. In other words, my experience knows this statistic to be plausible at the least, if not dead on. It hit me like a hollow-tipped shell (sorry, my roommate’s been playing a lot of Call of Duty recently) to the chest that I as well as that fifty-plus percent don’t read the very word of God that has been passed down to us.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“His divine power has granted to us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of him who called us to his own glory and excellence, by which he has granted to us his precious and very great promises, so that through them you may become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped from the corruption that is in the world because of sinful desire.” — II Peter 1:3–4</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Everything.</strong> Not just <em>most</em>, but <em>every</em> thing. And where are the referenced promises found? You got it, in the Bible. That thing over there on my desk/shelf/dresser/etc. that’s just collecting dust, do we, do <em>I</em>, not realize what is contained within the covers of that book? Could it really have within it the secrets to life standing in plain sight for any and all to see? Yes. But that doesn’t seem to be good enough. In my heart, I want something else, something more. What could exist that is <em>more</em>? This is <em>everything</em>. This is the account of God, grace’s crash course with our inherent shortcomings, the death and resurrection of Christ, and broken people being transformed radically in the wake of this phenomenon. What more, oh my soul, could I desire?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“For the word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing to the division of soul and of spirit, of joints and of marrow, and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart. And no creature is hidden from his sight, but all are naked and exposed to the eyes of him to whom we must give account.” — Hebrews 4:12–13</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Unchanged.</strong> We cannot read such a text and expect to remain the same. If the text is as it claims to be, there is no way we can hope to walk away unaffected. Then again, why would we wish this for such a piece of literature? Why would we desire it to be muted? Yet, that’s precisely what we’re saying when we cease reading and spending time in the Word. We are asking God to tone it down, to not be so active. We are asking God to be who He isn’t.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work.” — II Timothy 3:16–17</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>It’s the swiss army knife of the soul.</strong> Seriously, in that list, what is left out? What purpose could we possibly devise that isn’t included? Then, why does our Bible continue to gather dust? Why is it not being worn out like that favorite pair of sneakers we can’t let go of? Why are we not clinging to it as if our souls, let alone our lives, depended on it? Friends, these are questions we all need to be asking ourselves. Maybe the context of these questions needs to be with a trusted friend or group of friends who can help keep us accountable, but I’ll leave that to you.</p>

<p>We cannot ask for anything more than what we’ve been given in the Bible. We have literally been given everything to live a life following Jesus. We have a book that is explicitly meant to change lives, irreversibly so, yet we choose to stay the same, unaffected. We have every tool contained within it that we could possibly need, but we insist on doing everything shoddily with our two weak hands. I hope this makes no more sense to you than it does me. Let’s take today and use it to begin to turn the tide of this great ocean of fallacy into which we’ve waded. Let’s start with ourselves and bring our friends and loved ones with us one at a time. We’ll soon see that indeed, we’ve been given everything.</p>

          <h2><a href="/love-does-not-boast/">love does not boast</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p><em>Love does not boast</em>. In continuing through this passage one descriptor of love at a time, we come across boasting. In reading this word again, I quietly thank God that I’m not boastful as it’s something that was emphasized my entire childhood. In fact, every time I hear mention of the word I say a little prayer in my head thanking God that I don’t have to worry about this. And then it hit me. <em>This</em> is boasting. As innocent as it seems, it simply isn’t.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Two men went up into the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. The Pharisee, standing by himself, prayed thus: ‘God, I thank you that I am not like other men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even like this tax collector. I fast twice a week; I give tithes of all that I get.’ But the tax collector, standing far off, would not even lift up his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, ‘God, be merciful to me, a sinner!’ I tell you, this man went down to his house justified, rather than the other. For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but the one who humbles himself will be exalted.” — Luke 18:10–14</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>It’s a matter of the heart.</strong> As you see in this parable, the Pharisee wasn’t making a single claim out loud, rather in his heart he was boasting to God. Maybe for us it’s not as pronounced, or not about our worshiping, but I’m sure there’s something down there we’re boasting about. Obviously, for me it’s humility, but what is it for you? And if you’re thinking you’re a pretty humble person, then I’m willing to bet that’s it right there. Come on, be honest with yourself. Take a minute to figure out an area where you’re boasting currently.</p>

<p><strong>Capture that thought.</strong> Compared to whom are we better in this particular area? Why do we need to be better than this person? What is riding on this identity? In other words, why are we feeling the need to inflate our own ego in order to feel more important? Who told you you weren’t enough on your own? Shame on them! Shame on you for believing! <em>Do you not know who you are?</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“For you did not receive the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received the Spirit of adoption as sons, by whom we cry, ‘Abba! Father!’ The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God, and if children, then heirs — heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, provided we suffer with him in order that we may also be glorified with him.” — Romans 8:15–17</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>We are all children.</strong> We’re children of God chosen to be adopted and take on His holy name through Christ’s redemption of our sins. Even though a sinner, God thought you worthy. Are you any less worthy now? Now that you have chosen to draw nearer to Him, He who knows you inside and out, could He find you less worthy? Lay down this ugly shroud of boastfulness. Cast it aside and allow your Father to embrace you and love you for who you are. It wasn’t too ugly before and it’s not now.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“But he said to me, ‘My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.’ Therefore I will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may rest upon me. For the sake of Christ, then, I am content with weaknesses, insults, hardships, persecutions, and calamities. For when I am weak, then I am strong.” — II Corinthians 12:9–10</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Boasting is falsely inflating our egos at the expense of our neighbor. How can we love in this way? Indeed we can’t, but to move in the right direction we first have to look carefully at the cause or causes that bring about our need to inflate. What convinced us we were unworthy, ugly and in need of justifying our value? We are precious in God’s eyes and that matters more than the opinions of all six billion-plus people on this earth. We have been called worthy of spending eternity with God. What more could we ask? Therefore, if we are to boast, let us boast in all He has done and continues to do. It is only because of Him that we have come as far as we have today. Let us be thankful in our remembrance that <em>love doesn’t boast</em>.</p>

          <h2><a href="/if-it-aint-broke/">if it ain’t broke</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p><em>If it ain’t broke</em>… It’s what we’ve been telling ourselves for some time now, but I think it’s time to wake up. There is something horribly broken in the church and as Matthew Paul Turner, a fellow blogger and writer, <a href="http://matthewpaulturner.net/jesus-needs-new-pr/spiritual-abuse-must-stop-a-blog-post/">has pointed out</a>, it’s killing the church. The problem I see here is spiritual abuse and if you doubt me, consider the number of comments on the three post series as well as the fact that over 2500 people visited his site this past weekend alone. Friends, spiritual abuse is out there and it’s widespread.</p>

<p><strong>The Church is giving up.</strong> A major concern of the church recently has been the disappearance of the twenty-something crowd and the conjecture has widely been that they are giving up because the church isn’t “cool” enough for this demographic. What if we turned this argument around and said that many of these people are only giving up because the Church has already given up on <em>them</em>? What if these twenty-somethings who were kids raised in the Church are just now old enough to understand the term spiritual abuse and associate their youth group with the Catholic Church of the middle ages?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“He said therefore to the crowds that came out to be baptized by him, ‘You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? Bear fruits in keeping with repentance. And do not begin to say to yourselves, `We have Abraham as our father.` For I tell you, God is able from these stones to raise up children for Abraham. Even now the axe is laid to the root of the trees. Every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.’” — Luke 3:7–9</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>We don’t have the market cornered on God.</strong> Just like the Jews in the above passage, God doesn’t kowtow to our every whim. We don’t have some special connection to God that enables us to hear Him more clearly than anyone else. For that matter, neither does our denomination nor does our church staff. Therefore, we’re all fumbling around this giant rock, lost as the next person. How can we turn a blind eye to the atrocities committed upon souls daily? How can we assume that our pastors always know best? Have we become so naive that we once again allow the clergy to be our intercessors to God? What then did Christ do on the cross?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Do not be conformed to this world,[a] but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect.” — Romans 12:2</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Taste the fruit.</strong> Have you stopped recently to see the fruit you’re bearing? Have you put down your Facebook, Twitter, Foursquare, etc. long enough to inspect that soul of yours and examine the fruit you’re producing? While it may <em>look</em> good, is it producing fruit in others or helping them produce fruit of their own? This is a critical question in righting this ship. If we cannot examine the fruit in our own lives, how can we hope to help others? How can we help our church staff in discerning the fruits of their lives and decisions?</p>

<p><strong>Read your Bible.</strong> We live in a consumerist society built on instant and tolerance. Therefore, we don’t have time to sit down to a half hour quiet time reading God’s word everyday. We don’t have time to be studying doctrine and theology. We don’t <em>want</em> to learn doctrine or theology because it’s <em>intolerant</em> and <em>overbearing</em>. This is where this all falls apart, friends. If we do not know, then how can we fix anything? If we don’t take the time, then we’re sabotaging our own lives. While accomplishing this, we’re attacking others as they suffer our bitter fruit. We then have pastors and ministers overstepping the bounds of authority, but no one is there to challenge them, because no one knows better. The flock has been brainwashed by their own ignorance as they cannot measure the Church’s actions against the Scripture they don’t know. Then the Church withers and dies. Allow me to reiterate: the Church, <em>she dies</em>.</p>

<p>What we face today is a dire problem. We cannot hide any longer and pretend it isn’t, because we’ve been noticing a downward spiral in the Church’s attendance for some time now. As dire as it is, the solution isn’t difficult in the least. It merely requires us to follow as we are called to do. It requires us to slow down and reevaluate. It pleads for us to open our Bibles and read as if our eternal lives depended on it. It begs us to reflect on <em>how</em> we follow and what the byproducts of that has been. Most of all, it calls us to be transformed, concerned with loving God and those around us with a love worthy of a child of God. It leads us to acceptance of all through the mystique of grace. Friends, we cannot claim ignorance any longer thrusting our heads in the sand, saying, “<em>If it ain’t broke</em>…”</p>

          <h2><a href="/love-does-not-envy/">love does not envy</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p><em>Love does not envy</em>. In continuing my series on what love <em>is</em>, we find here that it <em>isn’t</em> envious. This is a pretty easy characteristic to see and write off as few of us are actually envious, jealous little Smigels running around trying desperately to get back (or get for the first time, whatever the case may be) our “precious.” I wish this were that easy, selfishly I do, but I’ve seen that it’s just not. Once we dig a little deeper (common theme around here) we see there is something down there we’ve probably been neglecting for some time.</p>

<p><strong>We swoon.</strong> That’s right, we have these ideas for how our friendships should look like, how our dating lives should unfold, etc. Mostly these ideas are formed of the movies (not to point a finger) we’ve watched and fairy tales we’ve read over the years. We’ve allowed the media to take hold of something so organic (relationships, that is) and coat it in plastic and sparkles. Think about it, what are your expectations of your best friend? How about of a significant other? You see, we are envious of what we have been convinced we <em>should</em> have. Whether you’re aware of this or not, it’s envy. Simply put, we want the relationships we’ve seen being certain they are what we should have but don’t.</p>

<p><strong>Don’t suffer.</strong> Now, I’m not saying that we all should suffer through awful relationships for the entirety of our lives. Please don’t misconstrue that idea. We all will have relationships where something goes awry or is off from the start and it needs a little mending. That is absolutely healthy and normal, so please don’t drop a good relationship like a hot griddle because you think I’m saying you’re now acting in jealousy. Let’s use some of the discernment God has thankfully given us in the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p><strong>Life’s messy.</strong> In case you haven’t figured out by now, as I seem to keep forgetting constantly, life doesn’t follow our blueprint and neither should our relationships, platonic or otherwise. Any relationship occurs between two deeply flawed individuals, thank God, and together we have a beautiful, visceral vortex of imperfections and insecurities flying around to create what we know as a relationship. My words don’t do it justice, but don’t you see the beauty in how God even here takes the imperfect and makes it breathtaking? It’s like two plus two now equaling five.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Then God said, ‘Let us make man in our image, after our likeness.’” — Genesis 1:26a</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Key word: image.</strong> Let’s remember that here. God didn’t make us as <em>exact</em> replicas and so while we share certain qualities, we are not little Gods running around the earth making good and merriment everywhere our feet tread. However, we were created to be in community, therefore <em>relationships</em>. It’s a little hard to be created in the likeness of a triune God without taking some of the interpersonal aspects as well. That being said, we <em>need</em> relationships as it’s part of our DNA. We need healthy and uplifting relationships that are mutually beneficial, experiencing all of life together. What we <em>don’t</em> need are expectations that we are or anyone else is flawless. What we don’t need is that envy for what we think we should have to creep in and poison the otherwise healthy.</p>

<p>Try this: write down what you expect in each of your significant relationships and I’m certain you’ll see I’m not crazy. You’ll look at your list and see that envy poisons all of our loves, but that’s OK. We’re aware of it now and it gives us somewhere to start. Remember, do not confuse a relationship in need of repair with one that’s poisonous. Repair is necessary from time to time in every worthwhile relationship. While we’re made in the likeness, the image of God, none of us are even close to being Him, let alone <em>are</em> Him. Therefore, relationships will never be perfect as they’re a product of flawed people like ourselves intermingling with one another’s flaws. Therefore, will we stop and smell the roses today of God’s garden of relationships in our lives or will we go fawn over another filled with silk flowers? The choice is ours, but regardless, <em>love does not envy</em>.</p>

          <h2><a href="/think-it-through/">think it through</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p><em>Think it through</em>. Three words I’ve heard many times in my life. Three words I’ve ignored nearly all of my life. I was a little bit younger and a little bit stupider than I am today and I’d found myself in a situation. To be honest, it was a situation that was far over my head at eighteen and still over my head today. Yet, there I was and I had to make a decision. My girlfriend at the time thought she might be pregnant and she’d asked me what I wanted to do if she was indeed. I had a choice that I was wholly unprepared to make. It turns out I didn’t have to make the choice as it was a false alarm, but I know what I would have chosen and that fact haunts me today.</p>

<p><strong>Your sin is greater than you</strong>. In this case, my sexual lust was greater than my own power. I knew it to be wrong and could cite multiple sources in the Bible, but I was held captive. I was in a prison into which I had walked willingly, but whose key I didn’t possess. Herein lies the trickery of sin as it is so easy to commit and walk in for a time, but soon we realize that we are locked in the cell from which we were freed. No, we cannot break out of this prison as these bars are not physical, but spiritual and therefore far greater than human strength could ever be. No, we something more, someone who has power in this realm.</p>

<p><strong>Our crimson has been washed white as snow</strong>. More words that I’ve heard throughout my short life and which I’ve ignored, but which are so crucial at this juncture. Christian, do you not remember that once you were set free from a heart and life full of sin? Do you not think that Christ’s forgiveness also extends to your current misleadings, or are they too great? Are you so mighty that your sins could not be covered by the Lord our God Himself? Are your sins so many that Jesus’ blood has run out? “May it never be!” (Romans 6:2) However, we do have to accept His forgiveness anew for this sin and therein often lies the problem.</p>

<p><strong>There is one way out of sin on our own</strong>. Yes, that way is to cover it up. For me, the cover up was in the possibility of abortion. You see what I’m getting at here? When we choose to sin, we must also be prepared to accept the consequences of that action. It’s simple responsibility, but my willingness to follow that rabbit hole then only shows a greater problem I see is that we’re so willing hide our sin that we will do most anything to accomplish that. My story is just a illustration of our gross unpreparedness to accept the consequences of our actions and instead we continue to choose greater and greater sins to hide each successive cover up.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Now if we have died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him. We know that Christ, being raised from the dead, will never die again; death no longer has dominion over him. For the death he died he died to sin, once for all, but the life he lives he lives to God. So you also must consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus.” — Romans 6:8–11</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Where can we go?</strong> I said earlier that our sin is greater than we are. However, I also said that Jesus is capable of forgiving any and all sin. He is, but there is a caveat. We must in the process forsake our strong desire to cover up that sin. That’s right. We are called to bring that struggle into the light of community and allow God’s tidal wave of grace to not only wash over us, but some others who may be in the same boat but need help overcoming. In other words, we need God’s grace so that He can help us overcome what we desire to turn from as well as to lift up those brothers and sisters out of the mire into which they’ve fallen. Yes, grace is the only place we can go and we do not travel alone.</p>

<p>Sin is far greater than we want to acknowledge, but grace is all the mightier. Friend, substitute whatever you are struggling with into my story and you see they are not so different. We are all great sinners, at least I know I am, and incapable of overcoming what ensnares me like wild game. However, if we but turn to the Savior, He is quick to release us and give our hearts wings once more. The alternative is to trade our traps for even bigger ones, but at least we will be free from the former trap. How long can that last us? No, there is nowhere to turn but grace, however before we leap it’s necessary to <em>think it through</em>.</p>

          <h2><a href="/love-is-kind/">love is kind</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p><em>Love is kind</em>. Here we have the second half of one of the most quotable sentences in the entire Bible. Yet, despite its quotability, I’ll admit I’ve been struggling this past week to define really what that phrase means. I keep repeating “love is kind, love is kind” in my head and the only thing that comes to mind is “duh!” It seems that love and kindness are ubiquitous; they are mutually inclusive. However, this hasn’t helped me in understanding this phrase and thus writing this post…or has it?</p>

<p><strong>Inseparable.</strong> That is precisely the relationship the words “love” and “kindness” have to one another. Kindness is love and love shows itself <em>in</em> kindness. That’s where my boasting about how I love ends. So often it’s easy to think that I’m showing love to those around me, but the <em>way</em> I’m conveying that love isn’t kind. Heck, it’s not even nice! Without kindness, how can we show love? I’m not referring to the push-over, yuppie kind of blind ambivalence, but deeply caring kindness.</p>

<p><strong>Almost doesn’t count.</strong> This isn’t horseshoes or hand grenades, so either we’re being kind or we’re not. More plainly, we’re loving or we’re not here. Friend, I’m afraid that if you’re anything like me, then we’re not loving as much as we convince ourselves we are. It’s not that we’re not capable, but because kindness is difficult. Genuine kindness cannot be manufactured like a smile or a particular inflection of the voice. Kindness wells up from the lifespring within our hearts. Kindness isn’t <em>from</em> us.</p>

<p><strong>It’s time to repent.</strong> If the last sentence didn’t turn you back, then I’m genuinely glad and excited for you. Perhaps now is the time to see that we have not loved as well as we thought and hoped. Maybe you’re ready for today to be the day to repent, turn, from the fallen picture we have of love and submit ourselves to a fuller picture of love complete with kindness. Maybe it’s time not only to <em>want</em> to love deep within, but also to <em>show</em> that love. What do we have to lose?</p>

<p>This isn’t complicated, friends. It’s tough, I know, but only because we’re trying too hard. We have to remember that God is love and love is from God (I John 4:7). Therefore, kindness as an attribute of love must come from God and <em>only</em> God. All there is left for us to do is desire it and ask for it. This gets back to <a href="http://104.193.143.57/~waywar13/ce/2012/01/16/unwilling-to-ask/">Monday’s post</a>, but we’ll find when we do desire it, we experience a beautiful symphony of wills as for a brief time our souls sing in tune with the angels. Either we are kind in our love or we’re not, but it must be both loving <em>and</em> kind. Let’s not perpetuate the lie any longer and submit at last to this beautiful love. Let us be swept away in the Heavenly and experience Him just a little more. We have nothing to lose. Come on, our world <em>needs</em> a love that is kind.</p>

          <h2><a href="/unwilling-to-ask/">unwilling to ask</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p><em>Unwilling to ask</em>. I don’t know what it was in particular, perhaps I was just afraid of upsetting my father growing up, but I neglected to ask him for many things throughout my childhood. He would promise me things and, I suppose in an attempt to not pester him, I would not remind him of those promises and then get hurt when he eventually forgot about them as humans are apt to do. Then, out of a desire to provide for me, my father would get upset with me for not reminding him of the promise and I would draw back in my shell even further. In this way, I set myself up for disappointment and it has poisoned my relationship with my Father. While I have overcome this with my earthly father, I still expect God to disappoint me as only humans can do.</p>

<p><strong>Thousands upon thousands of promises.</strong> That is the number of promises made in the Bible. Honestly, there are so many that scholars disagree on the exact number, but counts range all the way from 3,000 to 8,000. That’s some serious promising going on. Despite the number of promises, God hasn’t broken a single one. On the contrary, promises are broken by <em>us</em>, man. Just look at the Israelites if you don’t believe me. Even forty years of misgivings in the desert and God <em>still</em> didn’t give up on them. It was only over the course of hundreds and hundreds of years that God finally accepted the covenant as broken with a people who never kept it to begin with. I won’t enumerate all the promises, because I can’t, but suffice it to say there are many that are pertinent to our daily lives even today.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“And now, O LORD God, confirm forever the word that you have spoken concerning your servant and concerning his house, and do as you have spoken.” — II Samuel 7:25</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Asking for what’s been guaranteed isn’t disrespectful.</strong> Don’t fall into the same trap as me. A promise is a promise and it delights God when we seek those promises. In fact, He is overjoyed as He only promises, as is His good nature, what is <em>best</em> for us. Therefore, to desire what He has already guaranteed is both no sweat off His back as well as cause for celebration as for one instant our souls return to Eden where our will and God’s was one. It’s a glorious return to a place we know in the depths of our hearts, but to where we’ve physically never been. To ask for the covenant promises of God is to taste once more of a perfect harmony to which we will soon enough experience again, but forever. Instead of shame, we should be beating down the doors to receive this form of communion available to us everyday. Not only do we experience God through the process, but He delights all the more in us.</p>

<p><strong>Not asking, however, is disrespectful.</strong> God has already set aside these promises for us. He allocated our inheritances, if you will, long, long ago and so they have been waiting in His heavenly storehouses, pleading for our taking. In not asking for what has already been set aside, we tell God that what He has is not good enough. We are in essence waving our middle fingers high in the air and telling God we can do better. Yes, it is just that ingratiating to the Sovereign God of the universe. Can’t you see? It breaks God’s heart when we do not want and ask for the treasures he longs to give to us. These are things that He knows are for our best and yet we refuse to accept them. Or, is it because we think we ask too much? Friends, if God washed our sins, <em>all</em> our crimson stains, white as snow with the blood of His precious Son, what could He give that is more valuable? We are refusing what costs pennies compared to the multi-million dollar mansion of Christ’s sacrifice. Whatever the barrier, tear it down and <em>now</em>. Let’s no longer be selfish fools.</p>

<p>Yes, I called us fools, because there are literally <em>thousands</em> of promises that have been set aside and we sit complaining about the weather. There are a multitude of gifts and blessings waiting up in heaven for our asking, but we, for one reason or another, neglect to do so. Yes, this is supremely foolish! My own father got angry with me for not reminding him of his promises, because he wanted to give as much as he could (and still does). How is this any different with God? In fact, His desire is only that much greater! Quit making excuses and admit to yourself that in <em>not</em> asking, we are only choosing pride and rebellion against our wonderful and awesome Holy Father. Let us today lay down our swords of self-sufficiency and accept this divine gift of aligning our desires with those of God, if only for a moment. Let’s begin our return to the Garden and jump the fence of our unwillingness to ask.</p>

          <h2><a href="/love-is-patient/">love is patient</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p><em>Love is patient</em>. Three words anyone who’s been to a couple weddings will know by heart as well as just about anyone who’s stepped foot inside a church. I myself have heard it umpteen million times, yet I’m still in the dark. As many times as we’ve heard the saying, no one’s cared to explain and draw out a picture for us of patient love. No one, for that matter, has explained <em>any</em> of the adjectives used in this passage to describe love (I Corinthians 13:4–8). Therefore, today, we begin a weekly endeavor into the attributes of love starting with patience.</p>

<p><strong>Look no further than Hosea</strong>. If you’ve never read this book of the Bible, you’re really missing out here. In summary, God tells His prophet Hosea to marry a prostitute and start a family with her. Throughout the marriage, she is unfaithful, sleeping around and birthing illegitimate children. In spite of all of this, Hosea fights for his wife, searches for her and accepts her back with open arms each time. If this sounds strange to you, <em>good</em>, it should be. I don’t know of a single person today (myself included) who would suffer a marriage like this and yet God has been doing just this with us since the creation of mankind.</p>

<p><strong>See Job</strong>. We all know the cliché, “patient as Job,” but do we know the story? Job was an exceedingly godly man whose faithfulness Satan wanted to test. God, knowing full well Job’s heart, allowed Satan to do so. Throughout the course of the book, Job loses everything. When I say everything, I mean <em>everything</em>. After each loss (family, property, health), Job goes and worships God. Do you believe this? Not only does he <strong>refuse</strong> to complain, but Job goes straight to worshiping God. If this also sounds strange to you, it should. This is why patience is a virtue. To finish the story, God restores to Job all that he had and gives him many times more. God rewards our patience, but only in time.</p>

<p><strong>Patience is not passive</strong>. Let us not mistake patience for apathy. Patience is <em>active</em> as we’ve seen in both examples here. Both men did not sit about idly waiting for things to get better, but acted of their own volition to pursue love. Hosea would always go out looking for his wife and when she returned, he was found praying for her, ready to embrace her passionately. Job in his affliction consecrated himself and did everything he could to make sure nothing was standing between himself and God. Once he had done so, he worshiped God with all his strength, or whatever he had left at the time. Neither of these men opted for our form of patience praying that God will just make things better and waiting around for that to come. <em>No</em>, they were <em>pursuing</em> love through it all.</p>

<p>We are fickle. That is human nature, fostered mightily by our society. That, however doesn’t make it healthy. Love is not fickle and so to love more fully and deeply, we ourselves must wean off our fickle tendencies. It’s time to stop drinking this formula and move on to the solid food of patience. If we want to mature as Christ-followers, as people, our love must mature first. We have to evaluate our love and see it for what it is and isn’t, realizing the hard truth that we do not love. We are somewhere in between love and hate, but we are certainly <em>not</em> love. That’s OK, it gives us somewhere to start. Now, today, let’s show the world starting with those around us that <strong>love is patient</strong>.</p>

          <h2><a href="/its-all-so-complicated/">it’s all so complicated</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>It’s all so complicated. This is life in a nutshell these days. Nothing is as simple as it seems and our stress levels only keep increasing. Something is always lurking beneath the surface, turning straightforward decisions into a complex series of calculus equations. Black and white have given way to grays, an overwhelming multitude of them. We are left to decipher and often we’re caught choosing bad from worse.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“If I speak in the tongues of men and angels, but have not love, I am a noisy gong or clanging cymbal. And if I have prophetic powers, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. If I give all I have, and if I deliver up my body to be burned, but have not love, I gain nothing…So now faith, hope and love abide, these three; but the greatest of these is love.” — I Corinthians 13:1–3, 13</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s the age old question. Seeing as Paul wrote this several centuries ago, we know the church has been having a simplification problem for a long, long time. In his God-given wisdom, Paul distilled it down as simply as can be done, so that we don’t have to continue in our stressful ways.</p>

<p>Cut it out! We’re killing ourselves for no reason. We put the strain of appearance and perception on the outpouring of our own God-given hearts. We are adulterating pure love that is bursting forth from our souls. We taint the natural spring of light gushing within us and are left with dirty, brackish expressions in which love is scarcely found.</p>

<p>We are Christ to the world. Christ was love and now we are His face, His hands and His feet. We cannot be these if we are not willing to submit fully and with abandon to His love. It’s a love that was bound by nothing but love for God and love for His neighbor. His love abided only in love. Likewise, our love is to also.</p>

<p>That’s it. That’s all there is to it. All these people stressed out around me are stressing me out and I was already stressed to begin with. You see, it’s contagious. While it’s contagious, it doesn’t have to be chronic. We’ve got the answer to a weighty question, now it’s time to drop the rocks we’ve been carrying for so long. It’s time to lighten our loads and just love. We’ll find that in the process we’re also just living as life is love. We must first get out of our heads, past the fact that it’s all so complicated.</p>

          <h2><a href="/failure-to-communicate-theres-a-solution/">failure to communicate (there’s a solution)</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p><em>There’s a solution to our failure to communicate</em>. <a href="http://wp.me/p1iTRz-eM">Monday</a>, I highlighted the problem and today it is time for the solution. Boiling it down, the problem results from our deepest desire to know and be known intimately. The solution, I’m afraid, you will not like in today’s age of instant and pluralism. The solution gnaws at the very core of our intuition and instinct. The solution rejects our society at its core.</p>

<p><strong>This isn’t oatmeal</strong>. To satisfy our deepest longing, there is nothing <em>instant</em> about it. No, it takes time to invest in the lives of others and dig down into the rich soil of another’s life. Likewise, it will take a while for others to do the same. The process will be tough, probably tougher than ever, as we’ve had many generations of hardening the crust of that soil so that no one <em>can</em> penetrate it_._ Why? Because it’s scary facing the possible hurt and rejection that comes from letting others see what we perceive as ugly and unlovable. What we have forgotten is that the God of the Universe loves us infinitely and completely. If He who can love nothing ugly or imperfect can love us, then we are far from unlovable. Again, it will take time.</p>

<p><strong>There’s no “easy” button</strong>. Not only does true satisfaction take time, but it takes constant effort. The moment we think we are through, we need to put in more work than ever. There’s no website that customizes everything to our exact specifications and ships it to us in three to five days. This is precisely what makes genuine relationships worthwhile: they take <em>time</em>, <em>effort</em> and <em>risk</em>. Without the investment and potential loss, would relationships be worth <em>anything</em>? Cost is imputed only by what we are willing to give up in order to receive the relationship (in this case). Therefore, if we are willing to give up our deepest, darkest and most intimate elements, the true cost and therefore value is significant. However, the rewards are at least that great, if not multiples more. Time is a cost; it is an investment. Really, it doesn’t cost us much at all.</p>

<p><strong>Give it up</strong>. I mentioned risk earlier, but risk is integral to the solution. In today’s economy and society, we’re so risk-averse. We want to hold onto our money as closely as possible and we trust no one. You do with your money as you please, but the latter isn’t right. If the line of reasoning follows, then you cannot even trust yourself if everyone is not trustworthy. Then you are saying you are better than everyone else on the earth. People are essentially good-natured and I think we can mostly agree on that. Therefore, we need to get over our paranoia and let people into our lives. We need to risk them knowing our intimate secrets. We need to let people see us for who we really are and give them the chance to love that person. How can we be loved if no one is given the chance to love our unadulterated selves? We’re not only depriving them of this opportunity, but ourselves in the process. That being said, we have to be wise with who we share certain aspects of ourselves. Not everyone needs to know every tidbit about your childhood. Let people in.</p>

<p><strong>This isn’t multiple choice</strong>. There is only one option and it involves a few things our culture doesn’t like. In fact, everything here seems clearly counter-cultural and that’s the beauty. We need relationships, but first they take time. We have to be willing to forgo our expectation of instant gratification. Once we are willing to take the time, we also have to be giving our effort as well. There is nothing good in life that comes from laziness and relationships are no exception. Here’s the kicker: relationships require <em>risk</em>. They require us to give up everything we hold intrinsic to who we are and share them with the other person giving them the opportunity to reject us. Without any one of these, relationships are cheapened like a bad movie. In the end, we love the hero who risks it all and fights, winning over the course of much sweat and time. Dear friends, we have the opportunity of a lifetime to begin an end to this vicious cycle but it has to start with us. <em>There is a great problem, but we could be the solution</em>.</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p><em>We have a problem: a failure to communicate</em>. We are a society constantly in search of the next great social media outlet so we can connect with our friends, followers and loved ones. We are immersing ourselves in our social networks and fighting tooth and nail for each new follower. We share everything from random thoughts to weddings with our followers. But where has it all gotten us?</p>

<p><strong>All the world is a stage</strong>. I doubt this has ever been more true. Who we are online is but a persona, a character. It is a caricature of a real person. We portray who we want people to see us as. We put forth a convincing act deserving of Oscars, but this isn’t Hollywood, it’s the real world and no one’s paying us to be that person (unless your last name is Kardashian, perhaps). Tangents aside, we have become ghosts in real life, disconnected from our souls which are floating aimlessly online. The saddest thing about this is that we have no idea exactly where that soul is or, in some cases, if it even exists.</p>

<p><strong>What happened to relationships?</strong> The value of relationships has been replaced with likes and follows. We have tons of friends with whom we interact constantly, but online. That’s all well and good, but the relationships we have are about as deep as our LCD screens. They don’t even hold their own weight in water. We have traded depth for the multitude. We have opted for imitation over the genuine. This is why the next social media site can’t come fast enough. We’ll never get enough at this rate.</p>

<p><strong>Our souls are aching and crying out</strong>. If we believe we were created in the image of <em>The</em> Creator, then we can’t possibly imagine surface level interactions should satisfy our soul’s needs. God is triune, each member intimately in relationship with the others. No one part of God has a secret from the others. Yet, we live entire lives out of the sight of our “best” friends. We have put privacy rules on our lives where anything smacking of weight or substance is labeled as private and no one is let in. All the while, it is our very soul decrying the atrocity we continue to commit against our very selves.</p>

<p><em>There is hope</em>. I will get to that, but first it is crucial for us to marinate in the bitter sauce we’ve prepared for ourselves. We have to step out of our worlds with population one and begin to breathe again. We’re suffocating, but it’s our own hands around our necks. We have to breathe the fresh air of relationships and connection before we can recognize the undesirability of our current situation. Maybe I’m wrong and should go find some commune out in Montana where I can experience this with a few other fanatics and leave y’all alone. I won’t argue with you, but take a few days and reevaluate. If you see a problem, come back Thursday, otherwise no offense taken. I assure you, <em>we have a major problem: a failure to communicate</em>.</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p><em>We’re all searching</em>. After a long conversation with my father earlier this week, I was reminded of this most essential fact. Many of us don’t know for <em>what</em>, but I think we’re all aware that on some level we’re looking for <em>something</em>. There is a void in our lives that has to be filled and so we amass friends, money, possessions, power and yet we feel empty. Maybe it’s because we’re not searching for some_thing_, but some_one_.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“There is a God shaped vacuum in the heart of every man which cannot be filled by any created thing, but only by God, the Creator, made known through Jesus” — Blaise Pascal</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>The hole is infinite</strong>. Our longing is a bottomless pit and we can throw as many objects into it as we like, but it never gets any less empty. That being said, the question arises, “What is infinite?” The answer to this should provide direction for our search. <strong>God</strong>. We should seek to fill our vacuum, as Pascal called it, with God who is infinite as our longing is. The thing here is, He is the <em>only</em> thing who could ever fill the void as there is nothing else perfectly infinite after which we could strive. Yet, God is invisible and it is hard to see how invisible might fill a very tangible hole.</p>

  <p>“‘Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.’” — Matthew 11:28–30</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>We have rest for our souls</strong>. While on the surface it seems Jesus is offering us a break from our jobs, He hints at what He is offering of far greater value here in the phrase “and you will find rest for your souls.” Jesus knew thousands of years ago that our souls were never at rest and I would most certainly agree. In response to this, Jesus says that in Him we find the solution for our vacuum. In Him we find the infinite to sate our unending heart longings. We find satisfaction for an otherwise restless soul.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“For the word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing to the division of soul and of spirit, of joints and of marrow, and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart. And no creature is hidden from his sight, but all are naked and exposed to the eyes of him to whom we must give account.” — Hebrews 4:12–13</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>We all want to be known</strong>. Scary and ominous as the above passage seems, there is comfort beyond words to be found. I know of no one who can judge my intentions, certainly not with absolute accuracy. I even have trouble myself sometimes. God knows us so well that He, however, <em>can</em> always. He understands with such depth, that nothing we do goes misunderstood or hidden. In front of God, we are free to be completely vulnerable as He knows us more intimately than anyone and still loves us greater than all. Dare I repeat that; He loves us more intimately than <em>anyone</em> and still loves us greater than <em>all</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“By this we shall know that we are of the truth and reassure our heart before him; for whenever our heart condemns us, God is greater than our heart, and he knows everything.” — I John 3:19–20</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What are we waiting for? We know that we desperately need something and nothing we’ve tried yet has filled that longing. I know, because I’ve wandered through that midnight of the soul. Even at midnight is there a light and He is waiting with outstretched arms to make us whole again. He knows us intimately and loves us passionately if only we’ll stop running. If we only stop cursing His name, we find He is standing there even still. Through the insults and pain, our Savior waits with baited breath for our call. The only reason we’ve not found what we’re looking for is <em>ourselves</em>. <em>We’re all searching</em>.</p>

          <h2><a href="/we-all-receive-gifts-we-dont-want/">we all receive gifts we don’t want</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p><em>We all receive gifts we don’t want</em>. I received a flannel shirt several years ago, which at the time I thought to be the most heinous piece of clothing ever made. Strangely, I kept it and today it’s one of the favorite shirts I own. All that changed was my <em>perception</em> of the shirt in those few years, but it made a wholly undesirable gift into a prized possession. Silly as my example seems, let’s apply this to the gifts we receive daily from God. Many of God’s gifts, we shrug off as worthless until down the road we begin to understand their worth.</p>

<p><strong>Abraham was an unwitting hero</strong>. We’re all familiar with God’s promising Abraham he’d become the “<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=genesis%2012&amp;version=ESV">father of many nations</a>” and how he eventually got tired of waiting, so he had a son with his wife’s personal servant. However, what we’re not familiar with is looking at this act as Abraham not being satisfied with the gift God had given him. Abraham in this single act conveyed that God’s gift wasn’t valuable enough and that he could go and exchange it for something more valuable that <em>looked</em> like the original gift given. Look where that’s gotten us.</p>

<p><strong>David wanted more</strong>. I believe the story of King David and his taking Bathsheba as his wife is pretty well known also. David sleeps with Uriah’s (a great and honorable soldier in his army) wife Bathsheba who gets pregnant and David manipulates the situation to where he finally orchestrates Uriah’s death and David takes the now pregnant Bathsheba as his own wife. Once again, we see a man dissatisfied with all that God has given, so he gets himself another gift which he thinks of greater value than the rest. However, this gift is not and David only brings heartache and strife into his life and the lives involved, simply because God’s gifts weren’t good enough. At least, that’s what we deceive ourselves into thinking.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“And there was a prophetess, Anna, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was advanced in years, having lived with her husband seven years from when she was a virgin, and then as a widow until she was eighty-four. She did not depart from the temple, worshiping with fasting and prayer night and day. And coming up at that very hour she began to give thanks to God and to speak of him to all who were waiting for the redemption of Jerusalem.” — Luke 2:36–38</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Anna received well</strong>. By our standards, Anna lived an afflicted life. Her husband died seven years after they were married and rather than marry again, Anna chose to live as a widow. Not only that, but she moved to the temple and spent all the rest of her days worshiping God. She didn’t hurry off and remarry; instead, she was content with God’s gift. She was grateful for a gift that on the surface looks highly undesirable. But, her gratitude led her to seeing the Savior for whom she’d been waiting and praying decade after decade. Her ugly and seemingly worthless gift turned out to be an experience no one else could duplicate or take away from her. Her gift here really was <em>eternity</em>.</p>

<p>We receive many gifts that are undesirable at the time. However, we forget the greatest gift of all which was born as a helpless baby in a barn. That baby grew up to become the Savior of us all. What lies under the guise of that worthless gift? What value does that experience or promise truly carry with it? We’ll never know unless we give God a chance to show us. Remember, <em>we all receive gifts we don’t want</em>.</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p><em>How quickly we forget</em>. Christmas is this weekend and to be honest, my mood yesterday wouldn’t have given you indication whether it was Jesus’ birthday or Judgment Day. OK, the whole truth here is I highly dislike to use my brakes when possible and I was meeting my dad after work at Costco. You do the math, it wasn’t an enjoyable experience. And yes, brake lights do get the better of me, I’m disappointed to say. All that aside, I took a look at something I wrote a few years ago when I got home and it struck me plain as day. <em>How shortsighted am I</em>! This season isn’t about <em>me</em>, just as much as this life isn’t about me every other day. Yet, it seems when this should be most celebrated, it is farthest from my mind.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s nearing midnight on Christmas Eve<br />
I get to thinking and the thoughts turn to worry<br />
The tears of remorse I wipe with my sleeve<br />
Another year’s worth of selfishness brought back in a flurry</p>

Christmas, where are you?</p>

  <p>There should be joy and celebration, but my heart’s not free<br />
Held captive by the could’ve, should’ve, would’ve but didn’t<br />

Where I go and what I do in the next year doesn’t have to be where I went<br />

<blockquote>
  <p>On this the silent night, I hear my heart screaming<br />
Amidst the lights, there exists a hope for the year to come<br />
I’ll sing out this Christmas for the Savior again coming<br />

  <p>“Christmas, Where Are You?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Two thousand years ago, God accomplished the impossible</strong>. He chose the perfect woman in which to plant His seed and the perfect man to which she was betrothed to believe that God could do such a thing without the help of another man (i.e., adultery). This woman carried God’s Son and birthed Him in a stable. God was in baby form and He allowed this baby to take the normal course of maturation, enduring boyhood and adolescence until He dropped of the face of the map after the age of twelve and we don’t see Him again until He’s thirty. Jesus, God, was but an ordinary man born under never before and never again seen circumstances. He had a brother with whom He grew up and He carried on His dad’s work as a carpenter. On the surface, everything looked normal, but <em>His Father wasn’t a human or even on this earth</em>!</p>

<p><strong>He was the greatest gift of all</strong>. This is why we celebrate. The day Christ was born, Mary and Joseph unwrapped the greatest gift mankind <em>has</em> and <em>ever will</em> see. Each year we imitate this, giving gifts to loved ones and friends to show them as God showed us two thousand years ago He loved us more than anything with <em>His</em> gift. He showed us that even when the world did not love Him, His love was great to the point of giving us all His greatest gift as well. On that day, God showed His love greater than anything we could ever fathom.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“In this the love of God was made manifest among us, that God sent his only Son into the world, so that we might live through him. In this is love, not that we have loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins. Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another.” — 1 John 4:9–11</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is because of that fateful day, we have a definition of love. It is because of that day we can celebrate and rejoice, <em>forever</em>. It is because of that day we begin to understand the greatness of God. Finally, it is because of that day we know how we should love God and one another, <em>but how quickly we forget</em>.</p>

          <h2><a href="/your-life-is-a-drink-offering/">your life is a drink offering</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p><strong>Your life is a drink offering</strong>. At least Paul described his own as such in two different occasions, and given the context, it seems he was likening his life to wine (Philippians 2:17; 2 Timothy 4:6; Leviticus 23:13). If you’re at all like me, your first thought is something along the lines of, “What possibly could life have in common with wine?!” and you would be right to ask this question. Oddly enough, there is quite a bit in common.</p>

<p><strong>Not every grape grows well in every climate</strong>. Your soul also does not thrive under just <em>any</em> condition. No, God knew this and He created each of us for a specific environment. For instance, I would not thrive if I were supplanted to Atlanta. Why? Well, for starters, I’m not quite city folk, but I don’t have to be. For you it may be different. It takes a certain kind of person to be able to thrive in each environment and so understanding how you work with those environmental variables is crucial in <em>cultivating</em> your life.</p>

<p><strong>We have no control over the weather</strong>. Though the climate is right, we often encounter seasons that make it more difficult to see fruit as its result. This is what wine makers deal with every day of every year with both drought and over watering. Because we’ve understood the right environment, doesn’t mean there there won’t be anything we don’t have control over, there will be a lot, and we have two options in our reaction. We can either complain and ask the <em>weather</em> to change or we can <em>adapt</em> ourselves and be <em>joyful</em> throughout. Take a look here at each with Zechariah:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“And there appeared to him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense. And Zechariah was troubled when he saw him, and fear fell upon him. But the angel said to him, ‘Do not be afraid, Zechariah, for your prayer has been heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you shall call his name John.’<br />
“And Zechariah said to the angel, ‘How shall I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife is advanced in years.’ And the angel answered him, “I am Gabriel. I stand in the presence of God, and I was sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news. And behold, you will be silent and unable to speak until the day that these things take place, because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their time.’” — Luke 1:11–13, 18–20</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“And on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child. And they would have called him Zechariah after his father, but his mother answered, ‘No; he shall be called John.’ And they said to her, ‘None of your relatives is called by this name.’ And they made signs to his father, inquiring what he wanted him to be called. And he asked for a writing tablet and wrote, ‘His name is John.’ And they all wondered. And immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue loosed, and he spoke, blessing God.” — Luke 1:59–64</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>We have both options laid out before us</em>. Zechariah shows us both in the above verses. At first, he takes the situation and merely doubts. He doesn’t accept and try to make the best of the situation and he is muted. As a side note, his muting isn’t a punishment, but rather God’s mercy in helping Zechariah understand the folly of his ways. Then, once John is born and named, the first thing out of Zechariah’s mouth is praise to God. After nine months of being a mute, all Zechariah wants to do is speak blessings of God. <em>Wow</em>. Here we almost see a completely different person as Zechariah has chosen to make sweet aromatic wine and as we read it on the page, we drink it in. It here tastes sweet, smells of luscious fruit and is pleasing to the senses.</p>

<p><strong>This is how life should be</strong>. No one likes bitter, murky, sour, stinky or flavorless wine and we shouldn’t be OK with our lives being described in any of these ways. Life is to be bold, sweet (to taste), fragrant and otherwise appealing to the senses. If our lives are a drink offering as Paul’s, what are we offering up to God? Often times, my life more resembles vinegar than wine and those around me notice. However, this is not a drink offering. Each day, the decision is up to us: do we make fine wine under the circumstances we <em>cannot</em> control or do we sit idle and let the wine turn to the <em>vinegar</em> of doubt and complaining? It’s your choice, but your life <em>is</em> a drink offering.</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p><em>We only know how to receive</em>. With lines at stores being measured in the miles and tempers in nanometers, I have to ask the question: why do we do it? Why do we always seem to be so <em>stressed</em> this time of year? It’s the holidays, a time to celebrate, be joyful and enjoy the company of our families and loved ones, but instead we see depression, rage and a startling increase in suicides. Yes, I went there, but we as a society don’t <em>have</em> to each year. Once again, I’m led back to the question of why and can only think of one answer. It’s because we’ve lost the meaning of giving.</p>

<p><strong>Waiting in line for the perfect gift</strong></p>

<p>We will forgo countless hours of sleep on Thanksgiving and Black Friday just so we can secure our place in line and that perfect gift for our loved ones. While this sounds great on the surface, all the sacrifice, care and time spent, we need to probe our reasoning a little deeper. If we were truly trying to get the perfect gift to express our love for and appreciation of others, would you hear stories of murders and rampages that seem to break out each year? There’s obviously something more going on.</p>

<p><strong>Tempers flare</strong></p>

<p>Why are <em>so</em> many people <em>so</em> edgy this time of year? What happened to Andy Williams’ “It’s the Most Wonderful Time Of the Year,” you know describing this as the best part of the year? Instead, well, I’m sure you have stories of your own of people (maybe even yourself, not that I’d dare suggest that) snapping and doing something they’d rather take back. However, it seems rampant. What gives?</p>

<p><strong>Why do we give?</strong></p>

<p>Well, the short of it is that we give to show others we care. However, if that were true then I’d still be stuck here thinking about what to blog. You may disagree, but what I see is that we give so we can be on the other end of that perfect gift. In other words, we give to <em>receive</em>. We get irate when the potential glory gained by giving that gift is thwarted by the enemy nabbing the last item that we had so needed to complete our shopping list. We defend our honor as people try to invade our territory in the land of Best Giverdom. We take our frustrations and unmet expectations out on others because our gift giving ability we have taken on as a part of our identity and the thought of it being stripped away is simply too much to bear, so we fight with everything we have physically, emotionally and mentally to keep it intact. It’s war. However, the enemy is not our own twisted idea of giving, but those who stand in its way.</p>

<p><strong>This is ridiculous</strong></p>

<p>Jesus didn’t have a Christmas list and no one experienced road rage, yet the gifts given on the first Christmas were meaningful and from the heart. No one was shot or stabbed because the last jar of myrrh had been sold. No one stood in line at midnight on Black Friday to get the designer scent of frankincense. It was peaceful and unassuming, fit for a King. The wisemen were giving gifts of significant value because <em>they got it</em>. If we got it as well, would there be road rage in parking lots, depression, murder and the you-name-it we see today? On second thought, the world might just stop turning and hundreds of thousands of children might go disappointed on Christmas day. Sarcasm aside, wouldn’t it truly be a wonderful time of year if we started working on the fact that <em>we only know how to receive</em>?</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p><em>Death and a babe</em>. You’d be right in asking what a child has to do with death, but Christmas is that missing link. It was Christmas when God fully incarnated Himself so that He could overcome once and for all the sin that forever separated Him from His dear children. It is also Christmas, the baby laid in a swaddling cloth, silently sleeping in a manger in a stable, that distorts our view of who Jesus is today.</p>

<p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JM0a2YNH3gE&amp;hd=1]</p>

<p><strong>“He grew up, you know.”</strong> I’m blaming no one here, because it’s easy to lose sight of the fact that Jesus became a man after he was born and thirty-three years later forever bridged the gap between mankind and its benevolent Creator. It is even easier to overlook Jesus now as He sits at the right hand of the Father (Acts 2:33). Moreover, Jesus is gloriously awaiting His triumphant return to earth as the conquering king He has always been.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Then I turned to see the voice that was speaking to me, and on turning I saw seven golden lampstands, and in the midst of the lampstands one like a son of man, clothed with a long robe and with a golden sash around his chest. The hairs of his head were white, like white wool, like snow. His eyes were like a flame of fire, his feet were like burnished bronze, refined in a furnace, and his voice was like the roar of many waters. In his right hand he held seven stars, from his mouth came a sharp two-edged sword, and his face was like the sun shining in full strength.<br />
When I saw him, I fell at his feet as though dead. But he laid his right hand on me, saying, ‘Fear not, I am the first and the last, and the living one. I died, and behold I am alive forevermore, and I have the keys of Death and Hades.’” — Revelation 1:12–18</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>“I like the Christmas Jesus the best.”</strong> We get hung up on thinking of Jesus as a cute, cuddly mass of skin too big for His body, but this is <em>not</em> Jesus. That <em>was</em> Jesus at one point, but look above at the description John gave. There is nothing cute and cuddly about this Jesus. Jesus is magnificent beyond words. Jesus is so glorified that John’s only response, a friend of several years, is to fall down as if he was <em>dead</em>. Tell me, is this the Jesus you envision when you pray at night? Sure, it’s a nice mental picture, but <em>Jesus ain’t a baby</em>.</p>

<p><em>Meek and humble</em>. I think what we are to take chiefly from the nativity scene is the fact that the greatest King to have ever graced the earth with His presence came without pomp <em>or</em> circumstance. Instead, God had His Son born in a makeshift crib in…you got it, a <em>stable</em>. Jesus was born in the circumstances hardly befitting a migrant worker, let alone <em>the</em> King. Yet, the power in this scene is in the fact that He didn’t <em>need</em> anything more. Jesus came by the will of the Father to the lowest of lows and now He is exalted above all, reigning over heaven and earth. Jesus brought Himself down to the level of every man, so that He could empathize with and save people from <em>every</em> walk of life, not just the upper classes.</p>

<p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mrgTiEziHo]</p>

<p>Christ today is reigning above the earth holding the keys from His conquest of death and hell itself. This could not have happened had Jesus not come down to earth from His heavenly throne and gotten firsthand experiences of people living on what we consider to be the fringe of society. To do that, He had to become a baby as this is the way life works. However, He didn’t stay this way and he lived a life that has since shown light among the darkness of the human experience. He grew up and is no longer man, but fully glorified. Now that His birth it is we are about to celebrate, let’s remember it as the perfect emphasis that the life Jesus lived on earth and the life in heaven He now lives are nothing short of perfect meekness and humility to the sovereignty of the Father. Though we have less than two weeks, that’s plenty of time to prepare our hearts not to worship a baby, but to worship the greatest King, mighty and magnificent to the point where He would subject Himself to a vagrant’s birth. <em>Here</em> is the intersection of <em>death</em> and a <em>babe</em>.</p>

          <h2><a href="/were-learning-to-make-sense-of-it-all/">we’re learning to make sense of it all</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>We’re learning to make sense of it all. That takes a lifetime doesn’t it? And what primarily do we use to make sense of things but the Bible? Yet, despite this fact, most of us go along never knowing how to read the Bible or hardly read it at all, expecting to be taught it by others wiser than ourselves. Friends, this was never how the Bible was meant to be used. Instead, we were meant to learn for ourselves so that we may help others the unadulterated truths held within. We were meant to perform a sort of exegesis to unlock the beauty in all the aspects of the Bible.</p>

<p>It’s not a super-book of the Bible. Exegesis is not some combination of Genesis and Exodus meant to be read like watching the Lord of the Rings trilogy extended versions non-stop. If you haven’t already, don’t attempt that. Instead, exegesis is a systematic approach to the Bible that takes in some key factors to help lead to a deeper understanding of the text. For those of you who haven’t taken a class on this, Exegesis 101 (more like 001) is in session.</p>

<p>The Bible has a target audience. I hate to break it to you, but the Bible is still a piece of literatrue, albeit a masterpiece. Therefore, each book was written to appeal specifically to a demographic that is not 21st century America. There are metaphors and references that made sense back then to certain groups and it is our job to take those in their now antique-context. In other words, it’s irresponsible to assume that the text was written specially for you and me, therefore we have to use other sources occasionally (like a concordance) to unearth the true meaning of even simple references and phrases.</p>

<p>The Bible does not self-contradict. Whether you realize it or not, there are several accounts within the Bible, particularly the Gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke, that on the surface do not corroborate the story. Your interpretation of a passage also cannot contradict the rest of the Bible as you are leading yourself to the same conclusion of self-contradiction. In fact, it has been a great deal of study and debate that the Bible seems to flub certain details here and there, but the fact of the matter is it doesn’t. When you have however many different writers (we’re still not sure), there will be different perspectives and ways of conveying the same story. Therefore, so also will accounts of the passage of time vary. Seek out those differences and then try to understand better your writer and the deeper truth that they are trying to convey within the descrepancy.</p>

<p>Use context clues. The Bible is filled with confounding statements, but at the same time it is also filled with clues to shed light on those dark, cryptic passages. Not always, but often they’ll help you arrive at a basic understanding in the least. If that doesn’t work, don’t be afraid of your cross-references. They are great in finding different passages using the same word or phrase. Literary aids are your friend.</p>

<p>The Bible is chock full of God’s truth and it’ll take a lifetime to uncover. It’s up to us how much we want to delve into the text, embrace it and understand it. If we choose, exegesis can help. However, we have to remember that the Bible was written at a specific time for a specific people and so our understanding must also be contextualized. We believe the Bible to be inerrant, therefore our understanding of it should also be in fitting with its story as a whole. Finally, while there are many secretive passages, we have been given cross-references and context clues that help shed some of that mystery. No, we won’t understand the Bible completely today, but our intimacy with the Bible will increase if we take the time and effort. Remember, we only learn what God teaches our Spirit and we cannot rush that. We’re in this together and we’re learning to make sense of it all.</p>

          <h2><a href="/give-us-this-day-our-daily-bread/">give us this day our daily bread</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>Give us this day our daily bread. In French, it is le pain quotidien. I know this because there’s a French chain up in New York City with this name and it bothered me so much that I had to get the translation. Upon learning the translation, the first thing that came to mind was the phrase in the Lord’s prayer. This got the wheels turning and I had to ask the question what is our daily bread?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“‘It is written, ‘Man shall not live by bread alone.’’” — Luke 4:4</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Man cannot survive on only bread. Actually, the only food on earth that man can survive on alone is honey, but this is a tangent. I think of bread as a fundamental food and so Jesus’s words quoting Deuteronomy 8:3 are slightly jarring. I can imagine the disciples coming to Jesus afterward and asking Him the meaning of this. Teacher, it doesn’t make sense.</p>

<p>I’m thankful for this. Selfishly, I’m glad for these words because I’m gluten intolerant. But on another level, this is encouraging because it points to something to sustain me that I cannot knead and bake myself. It points to God and His word. It points to something that is supplied for me daily. It’s mystique making it all the more enticing.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“And he humbled you and let you hunger and fed you with manna, which you did not know, nor did your fathers know, that he might make you know that man does not live by bread alone, but man lives by every word that comes from the mouth of the LORD.” — Deuteronomy 8:3</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We live by the word of God, every word of it and that comes from time spent studying it and meditating on it. It comes from time spent with others studying it and contemplating it together. It comes from exhorting one another and correcting one another with it. It comes from living a life based entirely on God’s word. We are soul, mind and body and will wither if we do not properly feed each entity. God’s word can feed the soul and mind, which bread cannot. It’s not that we need only God’s word, but it is an integral part of a balanced holistic daily diet. Today, will you ask Jesus to “give us this day our daily bread?”</p>

          <h2><a href="/christianity-is-a-scary-beast-3d3c76a8042/">christianity is a scary beast</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p><em>Christianity is a scary beast</em>. If you look at it as a code of conduct, immediately you are confronted with a shopping list of <em>don’ts</em>. If you look at it as a philosophy, well it is counter-intuitive in more ways than you have fingers and toes. If you look at it as a way of life, then your world is turned on its ear. No matter how you slice it, <strong>Christianity doesn’t fit with our society or culture</strong>. Or does it?</p>

<p><strong>It’s going to take some adjustment</strong>. I’m not going to sugarcoat this aspect. Yes, there are many elements of Christian thinking strewn about philosophies and religions in this world, but no matter how close they may seem, they’re all missing the most critical point. God sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to die for the transgressions of the world about two thousand years ago and there was nothing you <em>could</em> do and nothing you can <em>ever</em> do to earn that favor. It is called <em>grace</em> and it alone is enough to wreck anyone’s worldview. Understanding how to fully accept this gift as well as submit yourself to give it out to others will take you your entire life. But, take heart, there’s a silver lining here.</p>

<p><strong>We have the Bible</strong>. Yes, it’s a big book with no pictures and thousands of verses, but contained within are the very words of God. Not only do we have the words of God, we have the words He inspired several very godly people to write down for us long after. The Bible contains everything pertinent regarding living the Christian life in love. The book covers every situation in life and is written for people from every walk of life. It is the greatest selling book of all time and we have it at our disposal every day.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“‘I did not say these things to you from the beginning, because I was with you. But now I am going to him who sent me, and none of you asks me, ‘Where are you going?’ But because I have said these things to you, sorrow has filled your heart. Nevertheless, I tell you the truth: it is to your advantage that I go away, for if I do not go away, the Helper will not come to you. But if I go, I will send him to you. And when he comes, he will convict the world concerning sin and righteousness and judgment: concerning sin, because they do not believe in me; concerning righteousness, because I go to the Father, and you will see me no longer; concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world is judged.<br />
‘I still have many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now. When the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all the truth, for he will not speak on his own authority, but whatever he hears he will speak, and he will declare to you the things that are to come. He will glorify me, for he will take what is mine and declare it to you. All that the Father has is mine; therefore I said that he will take what is mine and declare it to you.’” — John 16:4b-15</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Don’t underestimate the Holy Spirit</strong>. On that note, don’t be <em>afraid</em> of Him either. I’m willing to bet that if you’re anything like me, even the idea of the Holy Spirit is foreign, but knowledge of the Spirit is crucial. The Spirit is there with you every moment of every second of every day once you accepted Christ into your life. He is both speaking the Truth of God to your soul as well as constantly praying for your soul’s deepest desires. Oftentimes, we mistake Him for our old conscience, but that is only because He is now an integral part of us.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“And let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good works, not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another, and all the more as you see the Day drawing near.” — Hebrews 10:24–25</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Community is everything</strong>. Just as God used people like David and Paul to write down His Word, He uses people <em>daily</em> in our lives to enlighten us to new truths as well as reiterate old ones. Without community, we are merely a ship alone in the middle of the sea. This is never how God intended life to be. God Himself is never alone, so why would He create humans in His image to be alone? We need one another for guidance, support and to experience both giving and receiving grace and forgiveness. I wish there were words to express this, but I can only persist in my insistence on its paramount importance. Lacking this crucial element, we are but Pharisees.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“‘I have said these things to you, that in me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation. But take heart; I have overcome the world.’” — John 16:33</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Living the Christian life is a daunting task, but we have been given <em>all</em> we need. First of all, God graciously gave us His <em>word</em>, the Bible. Contained within is a sort of road map or manual covering the journey from point A to B and everything in between. Then, God has also given us His <em>Spirit</em> so that we can understand the truths contained in an otherwise nonsensical book filled with counter-intuitive parables and guidelines. We are under constant loving care because of the Spirit without even being <em>aware</em> of it. Finally, God delivers His grace to us though others and vice versa in <em>community</em>. He knew that alone we cannot stand and He doesn’t expect us to, so He gives us kindred spirits to accompany one another along the arduous journey throughout life. Do you, dear friend, make the most of all three of these? If not, then truly Christianity <em>is</em> a scary beast.</p>

          <h2><a href="/god-told-me/">god told me</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p><em>“God told me…</em>” Some of the most dangerous words in the world. I’m not going into detail, but several of the greatest atrocities in history have occurred through justification by this phrase. It’s the Jedi mind trick of religion. There’s <em>nothing</em> you can say in response to that. It’s because of this, I cringe every time I hear it invoked. However, it doesn’t have to be so dangerous.</p>

<p><strong>This is taking the Lord’s name in vain</strong>. Parading around committing acts of hate against others under the guise of God’s leadership is the worst thing we can do for His cause. Rather than showing them the face of God, we reveal to them a god of <em>hate</em>, <em>malice</em>, <em>bigotry</em> and <em>inequity</em>. Instead of putting out the flame of mistrust toward our faith, it is fanned anew. In the place of love and beauty, hate and ugliness are eschewed; surely this is <em>not</em> our God.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“And when [Jesus] had finished speaking, he said to Simon, ‘Put out into the deep and let down your nets for a catch.’ And Simon answered, ‘Master, we toiled all night and took nothing! But at your word I will let down the nets.’ And when they had done this, they enclosed a large number of fish, and their nets were breaking.” — Luke 5:4–6</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Jesus will ask crazy stuff of us</strong>. Jesus’ statement challenged Simon’s understanding of his world. He was a fisher who had just returned empty handed from a long night on the water. They were just getting in as he was washing his net and he must have been tired. Yet, this carpenter tells a fisherman to go <em>back</em> on the water. This is the very same water that had yielded <em>nothing</em> just then. Simon wasn’t exactly starving it seems, so he wasn’t the worst fisherman on the planet and knew what he was doing. Yet, Jesus turns to Simon asking if he will trust Him to know more about Simon’s livelihood than Simon does. Simon realized what Jesus was asking didn’t make sense, but it wouldn’t kill anyone, so he went along with it.</p>

<p><strong>The call of Jesus never contradicts the words of Jesus</strong>. This is very important here. Before we invoke the highest authority in our burning of x, y or z, we need to take a minute to verify what we think we hear with the words that God has <em>always</em> been saying. While we will be challenged to do things that don’t make complete sense to us, God will never ask us to do things that contradict the Word. And for those wishing to evoke images of Sodom and Gomorrah, Christ came so God didn’t have to resort to that anymore (depending on your armageddon beliefs).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“When many of his disciples heard it, they said, ‘This is a hard saying; who can listen to it?’ But Jesus, knowing in himself that his disciples were grumbling about this, said to them, ‘Do you take offense at this? Then what if you were to see the Son of Man ascending to where he was before? It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh is no help at all. The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and life. But there are some of you who do not believe.’ (For Jesus knew from the beginning who those were who did not believe, and who it was who would betray him.) And he said, ‘This is why I told you that no one can come to me unless it is granted him by the Father.’<br />
After this many of his disciples turned back and no longer walked with him. So Jesus said to the Twelve, ‘Do you want to go away as well?’ Simon Peter answered him, ‘Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life, and we have believed, and have come to know, that you are the Holy One of God.’” — John 6:60–69</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“…To whom shall we go?” One of my favorite phrases in the Bible illustrates what should be our reaction to hardship and confusion. Jesus had just gave a hard message to people who simply <em>weren’t</em> getting it and whom He knew would <em>not</em> get it at least then and many of them left. Even the disciples were visibly perplexed, but rather than walk away like the masses, they stayed to <em>verify</em> their understanding with the Word. They sought the Truth rather than looking for another master with a less confrontational message. <em>They checked their facts</em>.</p>

<p>If I a Christian cringe at the invocation of God’s name most of the time, how can we expect non-Christians to react? There have been many events in the past, both distant and recent, that have tarnished the name of God, but this doesn’t have to always be. God is speaking to you, that’s a fact. However, when you hear it, verify with His truth what you are hearing is <em>Him</em> and not what you would <em>like</em> to hear. Let’s be responsible when we say, “God told me…”</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p><strong>Ungrateful</strong>. I’d have to admit that this is a good, albeit unfortunate, characterization of myself. This is what I came up with as I was racking my brain in hopes of an appropriately themed post for the holiday. I’m not saying that I’m incapable of gratitude, as there are many things I <em>am</em> grateful for, but the number of things for which I’m <em>not</em> is astonishing. Rather than merely take stock of that for which I’m already grateful, I want to look at those things I’m not and see if I can’t give them a second chance. After all, as we established <a href="http://104.193.143.57/~waywar13/ce/2011/11/21/i-was-just-trying-to-get-there/">Monday</a>, there is plenty of grace in the now.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hallelujah, grace like rain falls down on me<br />
Hallelujah, all my stains are washed away, washed away<br />
“Grace Like Rain” — Todd Agnew</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Closed doors</strong>. I often pray that when I’m seeking God’s guidance He both opens and shuts doors accordingly. However, I’m really praying that He opens a bunch of doors. When I look back, the closed doors have been just as important in my life as the opened ones and even more so in some cases. But this isn’t the way I typically look at the situation. Whenever a door is closed, I continue to labor over the decision because “I didn’t really want God to close the door, but now that He has, is it <em>really</em> closed or am I just <em>thinking</em> it’s closed? I don’t know,” and the debate rages on in my head. While I pray for this and God answers those prayers, I’m not satisfied with the answer I get.</p>

<p><strong>Missed opportunities</strong>. I don’t know of a person on earth who is thankful for these bad boys. However, they are equally a gift as the opportunities of which we’ve made the most. They have shaped my life just as much as the other opportunities. Looking back, there are several opportunities I almost did not miss, but had I not, my life would be vastly different. Many of these opportunities would have taken me away from doing what I love and have been created to enjoy. The problem was that I didn’t realize that at the time. In His providence, God enabled me to miss these opportunities and continue to be more like the person I was always meant to be.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose. For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the firstborn among many brothers.” — Romans 8:28–29</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>There’s more</strong>. There are so many things that have come up the past couple days, but these have been just a couple that I’ve been able to start processing the past day or so. What is it for you? Is it a speeding ticket, losing the championship or maybe losing your job? These are all hard to be thankful for, but I think we owe it to ourselves and to our God to find His grace in the midst of what we see as calamity. He is not quick to turn away those earnestly seeking Him (Jeremiah 29:13).</p>

<p>It’s Thanksgiving, so let us be thankful for all that we’ve been given. However, let’s challenge ourselves and one another to be thankful also for the things for which we find thankfulness difficult. When we get down to it, grace surrounds us in our victories as well as our defeats. Each has its own perfect place in God’s plan for our lives and each life a perfect place in the Story of redemption unfolding in our world today. Eat some good food today, love those around you and keep your mind away from that dirty word. The alternative is to be bitter and ungrateful.</p>

          <h2><a href="/i-was-just-trying-to-get-there/">i was just trying to get there</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>I was just trying to get there. However, due to my relaxed view of time and security being closed for about 15 minutes, I missed my flight. I was no longer able to arrive Friday night, but had to spend the night in Newark before I could fly out to Kansas City and see my girlfriend and her family. I was livid.</p>

<p><strong>I was done with the journey</strong>. It hadn’t even begun in earnest, but waiting to fly out to Newark, I only wanted to arrive at my final destination. Getting to Newark was merely bitter as I looked for a place to get “comfy” and deal with a night in the airport. Beside myself, I was asking how I could have allowed that to happen. It took me several hours to realize this was merely a part of the journey. As such, there was grace to be found in the moment. Sleep was terrible, but it no longer mattered. I was there for a journey.</p>

<p><strong>I am dense</strong>. God was trying to get my attention from the moment I missed my flight. I made the call to let the young lady know what had happened and she admitted she was disappointed, but said nothing more. She was for the most part fine with it. I was expecting…well, a much less favorable reaction. Once I got my new itinerary, I had tried to see if I could arrive earlier taking another airline. Her response was the amount of time gained was not worth the expense. Once again, God was whispering. It took me several hours and some new acquaintances before I was going to let go of this one.</p>

<p><strong>The destination is but a point</strong>. If I am so intent on the destination and that is but a point on the timeline of life, there’s a lot of line in between that I’m choosing to wish away. There’s a lot of life I’m wasting. In wasting that, I’m telling God that I don’t believe His grace is worthwhile in the journey. I should be expectantly awaiting the destination, but balancing that with the understanding that the journey is what makes the destination worthwhile. Why was I in such a rush?</p>

<p><strong>We wish away current grace</strong>. There’s this stigma that has us eking out a life on earth half alive believing we are holding out for the grace of heaven. Somehow, God’s grace in death is infinitely more valuable there than on earth. God’s future grace is greater than that of the current. There is nothing of God less valuable than anything else. We can’t create this false dichotomy, especially since it leads to a suffering through the present. Sure, there are trials along the road, but as I learned this weekend, there is abundant grace here as well.</p>

<p>It’s easy to wish away the current. However, it’s the growth we experience along the way that makes the destination worth anything. It is the experience of grace that grows us and shapes us along the way, but we have to be receptive to it. Called to make the most of the time, it doesn’t make sense trying to wish away a majority of it. We have to buck the habit of always being in a hurry and stop to smell the roses of grace. They are sweet, fragrant and reviving of the soul. These roses remind us that God’s grace is just as beautiful now as it has been and will ever be. Grace has no degree, it is either complete or not at all and God’s is always complete. Each day we have a choice whether we bask in God’s grace or just gripe about the immediate circumstances. Don’t choose what I stewed in most of the trip as I was just trying to get there.</p>

          <h2><a href="/the-foundations-already-been-laid/">the foundation’s already been laid</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>The foundation’s already been laid. What you may not have noticed is that <a href="http://104.193.143.57/~waywar13/ce/2011/11/14/our-foundations-cracked/">Monday’s post</a> had no conclusion. This was actually unintentional. However, the fact that I did not myself realize it speaks to a bigger problem. Where do we fix this foundation if it’s cracked?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“For no one can lay a foundation other than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ. Now if anyone builds on the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw — each one’s work will become manifest, for the Day will disclose it, because it will be revealed by fire, and the fire will test what sort of work each one has done.” — I Corinthians 3:11–13</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Yes, that was a trick question</strong>. Problem is, it certainly doesn’t <em>feel</em> like one. I know it didn’t for me as I wrote the last post. That’s dangerous. Honestly, that is a problem just as big as the issue of a shoddy foundation. That problem is self-deception.</p>

<p><strong>Christ laid the foundation on the cross</strong>. That’s right, it’s all there in His death and resurrection. There are plenty of examples in His life, but everything crucial for faith is wrapped up neatly in those three fateful days. We have all the elements of our faith sitting at the foot of the cross. <em>That</em> is our foundation and <em>nothing</em> more. Can man crack that?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Then Jesus told his disciples, ‘If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.’” — Matthew 16:24</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>“Follow me.”</strong> This was Jesus’ message to all His disciples as well as people who could not forsake the world to follow Him. There were no other instructions. He only told His disciples to follow Him. Let that sink in. There is no ‘x’-step process. It isn’t even a process. It’s an action. Either you’re responding “yes” or “no,” but “maybe” is not a choice. “Kinda, sorta” doesn’t fly with this directive. This isn’t a matter of the gray. It’s so uncomplicated. Yet, what else is this simple? That’s what makes it so complicated.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, that the man of God may be competent, equipped for every good work.” — II Timothy 3:16–17</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>We have it all</strong>. That’s right. The road map is the book that has most likely been accumulating dust in a corner (if you’re me) or on the shelf for normal people. We’ve bought the lie that we don’t have enough to decipher the mysteries of the Bible. This is precisely why the Gospel According to Thomas is not in the protestant canon. There is no gnosis as we know it. The “secret” truth is revealed by the Spirit (I Corinthians 2:12). It is spoken to our hearts in an ancient language that only our souls understand. We are <em>more</em> than capable, but we are capable because <em>God</em> is capable. The missing link in this case is God’s grace that we only choose to recognize at times. Yes, we have been given everything we could possibly ever need.</p>

<p>The crack in our foundation is only our understanding. We don’t realize that our foundation was never cracked in the first place. That serves as the chink in our armor. We’ve spent so much time trying to build upon the foundation of Christ’s “follow me” that we can no longer see the sturdiness underneath. Instead, we are overwhelmed with the shoddy straw and dirt that will surely be consumed in the crucible of life. This doesn’t have to be, because we have all the tools we need to build a sturdy structure in the <em>Word</em>. It’s so simple, it’s overwhelming. But, I’m telling you, that’s all we absolutely need. Now, today I challenge you to orthodoxy which has become radical in our day. Get together with a friend, parent, spouse, etc. and hold one another accountable to the reality. The foundation’s already been laid.</p>

            <p><strong>Our foundation’s cracked</strong>. The house that is our faith is crumbling in upon itself and we are left inside fixing to be crushed. Actually, we haven’t even noticed the walls bowing in toward the center of the building. Regardless, whether we know or care, <em>the house is about ready to cave</em>.</p>

<p><strong>The average Christian has no foundation for their faith</strong>. I’ve painfully become aware of this over the past five or six years. Having conversations with people who grew up their entire lives in the church only to find out they were less than certain of their salvation. <em>Do you notice something wrong here</em>? If you don’t, please, this isn’t the blog for you.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I believe in God, the Father Almighty, the Maker of heaven and earth, and in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord:<br />
Who was conceived by the Holy Ghost, born of the virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and buried;<br />
He descended into hell.<br />
The third day He arose again from the dead;<br />
He ascended into heaven, and is seated at the right hand of God the Father Almighty; He will come to judge the quick and the dead.<br />
I believe in the Holy Ghost; the holy catholic church; the communion of saints; the forgiveness of sins; the resurrection of the body; and the life everlasting.<br />
Amen.” — “The Apostles’ Creed”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Do you know how many versions there are of the Apostle’s Creed?</em> Look on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostles%27_Creed">Wikipedia</a>, there are over <em>five</em>. The very thing that forms the nucleus of the Christian faith, yet there is no consensus on this. It’s no wonder we are not being taught the fundamentals for our faith. We’re too busy arguing over what translation of the Bible and Apostles’ Creed is best. We’re too worried about the minute details. We’re too worried about being <em>unique</em> and <em>right</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“‘Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves. You will recognize them by their fruits. Are grapes gathered from thorn bushes, or figs from thistles? So, every healthy tree bears good fruit, but the diseased tree bears bad fruit. A healthy tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a diseased tree bear good fruit. Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. Thus you will recognize them by their fruits.’” — Matthew 7:15–20</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Faith is suffering</strong>. Souls are being disillusioned into thinking they are getting fed and have been provided for when in fact their need for foundation to later be built upon has not been met. We are trying to build up houses for our souls that have nothing to support them. <em>What are we, the Bluth construction company?</em> (Arrested Development, anyone?) We grow up under the identity of Christian believing fully that we are, yet the only people really fooled are ourselves. The nonbelievers around us are right. There isn’t anything different about us, because we never took the time to lay the groundwork for that difference. They see through our facade and recognize the house of cards that is our fragile faith. They know, as should we, it could fall at any moment.</p>

<p><strong>We have a warped view in the church of what’s truly important</strong>. The look of our worship band doesn’t really matter. Our officially recognized translation of the Bible is hogwash. No one cares what wafer you use for communion. Denominations have spent so much time, even the nondenominational church (where I’ve spent most my life), distinguishing themselves from one another. Churches <em>within</em> each denomination have also done the same. It is the result of treating the church as a business in the marketplace for warm bodies. The marketing is all wrong. The church is in the business of <em>souls</em> and has <em>always</em> been. In fact, we are all under the same management, if you will. We are all parts of the catholic (worldwide) church serving Jesus. Rather than focusing on the differences, where are the similarities? Where is the assurance of salvation and the basics of faith?</p>

<p>Our church has been suffering a long time from lack of <em>substance</em>. We are raising up strong Christians who find out in the worst way they have nothing to support their faith. They become lost, disenfranchised and eventually lost to the world, <em>maybe</em> returning later on in life. These souls crave this foundation, but basics are not <em>sexy</em> in the Christian world. Being radical and starting nonprofits to save the world, instead, are. If we only realized, we could do so much more by providing the necessary foundation for the rest (). Faith is something to <em>fight</em> for everyday. Will you today go down and look at your foundation, maybe for the first time? When you do, will you find your foundation’s cracked?</p>

          <h2><a href="/thats-not-me/">that’s not me</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p><strong>That’s not me</strong>. That’s not who I <em>really</em> am. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve said this as a young evangelical. I can tell you even less about how many times I’ve heard it from others. It’s a popular phrase amongst a group of people navigating both personal discovery as well as God’s sanctification, often both for the first time. They are harmless phrases meant to express the tension of living in between Jesus’ resurrection and His return. It is imperfect people called to perfection characteristic of a holy follower of Christ who have not yet attained the complete throwing off of the old self. <strong>It’s poison to your faith</strong>.</p>

<p><em>If it’s not me, then who is it?</em> Seriously, who am I fooling when I say this? I act as if some mad scientist took over control of my brain for however long while I lived and acted like the sinful hellion I was at the time. The fact is, there is <em>no</em> scientist in the picture that I know of. In fact, <em>I</em> may be mad, but I know myself not to be a scientist of any kind and chemistry was sure to inform me of that my first year in college. So, it’s just me. <em>I</em> am the reason I act the way I do. It is <em>my</em> choices that led me to live out whatever sin I committed. <em>No one else</em>.</p>

<p><strong>I can’t just pick and choose</strong>. I am who I am and that is who God has graciously made me (I Corinthians 15:10a). What you see is <em>what</em> you get. I cannot take that person and deny the existence of certain attributes or tendencies that make up the whole. Otherwise, I am only part of a person and I don’t recall God being in the business of creating part-people. I don’t know what one would look like, but that is certainly not how I’ve been made. Who I am has a lot to do with <em>what</em> I do and denying my fallen nature only serves to deceive myself and perpetuate the lie so that people around me feel more comfortable deluding themselves in a like fashion. This is a spreading of the poison.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” — I John 1:8–9</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Own up to it</em>. This is our calling as sinful people in the process of sanctification. It is not that we are called to perfection, but to recognition and confession of sin. This is how we are <em>perfectable</em>. That is to be true of us. Being “born again” never meant living as Christ, overcoming any and all sin that confronted Him. We are imperfect creatures in search the heart we lost at the Fall. We are in search of Eden, but we cannot enter it until God has called us back home. We cannot because while our sin nature does not own us, while we are on this earth it will be undoubtedly present.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Therefore, confess your sins to one another and pray for one another, that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous person has great power as it is working. — James 5:16</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Community, community, community</strong>. <em>Yes</em>, that was just a sentence and <em>no</em>, I cannot stress this enough. Do you see its importance here? Community is <em>paramount</em> in the life of one seeking holiness. Without community, we are not able to draw upon one another’s trials and triumphs. Without one another, the road to sanctification is lonely and arduous. We need each other to keep upright through the bitter winds and torrents of life. We need the physical act of confession as it often gives us insight into the confession which takes place between us and our loving Father. Community, we cannot live without.</p>

<p>That’s not me. Yes, it is and not only is it me, but I can’t keep lying to me. There is a nature that I’m sure we’d all like to forget about, but doing so only gives it more power as we turn a blind eye to it. We need to take responsibility for that as well as the areas in our lives where we see God’s perfecting work. They are just as important to Him as they ought to be to us. When we confess these undesirables, God does not force us to wallow in them, but delivers us from them. Don’t we want that? Is that not the point? And this confession, it is not only solitary, though important, but also has a communal aspect to it. There needs to be community in our efforts against sin. I need it, you need it, we all do. Therefore, please, stop spreading the poison and pretending we’re part-people. Contribute to the solution today, because the church needs real, broken people living life, <em>all of it</em>, together. Amen.</p>

          <h2><a href="/disbelieve-well/">disbelieve well</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>Have you ever thought that maybe we don’t disbelieve well? I think the better question is have we ever thought that the way we disbelieve is important? I know that before this past weekend, the thought had never crossed my mind. However, in a life that God knows is is <em>filled</em> with disbelief, don’t you think He might place a <em>little</em> importance on the topic and help us out in the process with an example? I don’t know how one grows in their faith without some form of disbelief and so I was thankful to find this example.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“But on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they went to the tomb, taking the spices they had prepared. And they found the stone rolled away from the tomb, but when they went in they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus. While they were perplexed about this, behold, two men stood by them in dazzling apparel. And as they were frightened and bowed their faces to the ground, the men said to them, ‘Why do you seek the living among the dead? He is not here, but has risen. Remember how he told you, while he was still in Galilee, that the Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men and be crucified and on the third day rise.’ And they remembered his words, and returning from the tomb they told all these things to the eleven and to all the rest. Now it was Mary Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the mother of James and the other women with them who told these things to the apostles, but these words seemed to them an idle tale, and they did not believe them. But Peter rose and ran to the tomb; stooping and looking in, he saw the linen cloths by themselves; and he went home marveling at what had happened.” — Luke 24:1–12</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Jesus warned the disciples many times of His crucifixion and resurrection, but they still didn’t believe</strong>. This fact is rather encouraging to me. When they were told of the tomb’s emptyness, they all <em>dismissed</em> it. You could argue it had something to do with the fact that the messengers were all women and women in that culture were not highly regarded. You might be right to a degree here, but one of the women was James’ mother and I’m pretty sure he didn’t just disregard everything that came out of her mouth, so that doesn’t carry a whole lot of water in this case. Simply, the news was too fantastic to be possibly true.</p>

<p><strong>Peter refused to take disbelief at face value</strong>. He knew the tomb was not far away and so the passage ends with him <em>running</em> (not walking) there and finding out for himself. While the other ten disciples chose to disregard the report given to them that the tomb was empty, Peter decided that was not good enough for his troubled mind. It’s a pretty simple concept he displayed here. He didn’t believe, but since the tomb in question was a short distance away, he went there to find out firsthand. Because of his curiosity, it seems that all the disciples benefitted.</p>

<p><em>Peter showed us active disbelief</em>. This is the problem with our disbelief. We merely choose to disbelieve something and often don’t take the time to run to the issue in question and find out the truth of the matter firsthand. I know I have contented myself many times with the fact that I don’t believe something and that is just the fact of the matter. That <em>can’t</em> be the fact of the matter if we want a faith that is growing. This settling is a conscious decision to stagnate faith. This is spiritual complacency and laziness. This is the beginning of the road to spiritual <em>death</em>.</p>

<p>The way we disbelieve is crucial. It says a lot about our relationship with God. It evidences whether we are serious about loving Him more intimately, living the life we proclaim. Disbelief is prevalent in this existence and there is no way around that fact. However, this lends some importance to the <em>way</em> we disbelieve. Rather than settle for a surface disbelief, let’s strive for an unbelief that benefits the community around us. Let’s push ourselves and those around us onward to a disbelief that is active and never satisfied with the easy throwing our hands up in the air. Let’s follow the example of Peter and disbelieve <em>well</em>.</p>

          <h2><a href="/anything-but-balanced/">anything but balanced</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p><strong>My life is anything but balanced</strong>. I rarely sleep enough. I’m <em>always</em> running late. I spend too much time surfing the web. I don’t spend <em>enough</em> time doing the things I claim I care most about. And God <em>never</em> gets enough of my time. I know I’m not alone and I think we as a culture are <em>anything</em> but balanced.</p>

<p>[youtube=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ohl3ZOe1M-s&amp;hd=1]</p>

<p><strong>Balance</strong> is precisely what the Christian life is to be. It is a balance between sorrow and <em>joy</em>. It is the space amidst <em>peace</em> and tension. It is the eye of the storm. However, I know you couldn’t gather any of this from my lifestyle. The Christian life seems to be one of irony, but the only <em>irony</em> seems to be the fact that we don’t see it ourselves.</p>

<p>As we grow in faith, so does our awareness of sin, but this pales in comparison to our growing awareness of <strong>grace</strong> (Romans 5:20). In this way, we find balance between our sorrow over sin and iniquity and they joy inherent in God’s endless grace. If we focus too much on our sin, we become <em>self-loathing</em> and adopt a view that Christ’s blood was not enough to cleanse the soiling of our sin. If we focus too much on grace, then <em>licentious</em> is the label we fall into. No longer does sin matter and we once again shackle ourselves to this most cruel of masters (Romans 6:1–4).</p>

<p>We are to be aware of the inability of our humanity, yet find <em>peace</em> in the necessary submission. For those of you reading critically at this point, we all know no one is perfect. However, that is <em>precisely</em> what we must be to enter the Kingdom of Heaven. Therefore, in this way we are at a loss. In full knowledge of this, Jesus spelled out how we can be saved from ourselves. He died <em>one</em> final death to imperfection for <em>all</em> (Romans 6:10–11. He sacrificed His life to show how we should obediently live a life of meekness fully dedicated to the Father. Focusing too much on our limitations leads to a life of <em>apathy</em> and <em>self-pity</em>. Yet, ignoring the inevitable recognition of our finite nature, we seek to become gods and <em>challenge</em> the only God for sovereignty.</p>

<p>We live in a world at war with itself. At the risk of making an obscure political statement, all around us is another story of us against them. We are called to be in the thick of it. It is our charge to help the world understand its brokenness and so take on the role of aggressor in a sense, though aggression is to have nothing to do with our conduct. At the same time, it has been our exemplified calling to willingly be the “them” decried by society, thus taking on simultaneously the role of afflicted. The coexistence of these roles in my life makes no sense, but they are <em>essential</em>. Without the role of aggressor (pardon my lack of vocabulary), we are spineless and our faith does no one good, not even ourselves. If we forget to turn the other cheek, then we are no better than a militant cult and deserve whatever ridicule may follow.</p>

<p>Irony is inevitable when you find hope, joy and peace in one man’s death. It is a paradox at any level, but within the paradox is our <em>balance</em>. We find <em>joy</em> in both the awareness of our iniquity and our salvation from it. We find <em>peace</em> in the presence of both inability and empowerment through submission. We find <em>shelter</em> in the midst of war and chaos. It doesn’t make sense, because it’s not supposed to. Rather than try to make sense of it, shouldn’t we entrust that to our loving and capable God?</p>

          <h2><a href="/running-at-dusk/">running at dusk</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>There’s a lot we can learn from running at dusk. I’m sure most of you have gone running at least at some point in your lives. I’m also sure that you have experienced a gravel road or two. However, I’m not sure if everyone has had the experience of going running at dusk on an unlit back country road. I can’t say that I recommend it, but I was grateful for the observations of life I was able to glean from it.</p>

<p><strong>We know from where we’ve come and our destination</strong>. Everything in between is a mystery to you. Sure, you have a general idea of certain events that may transpire, but how they look exactly is beyond you. It doesn’t matter how many times you’ve been there before, everything seems and feels different. You can’t rely on your past experience to guide you through alone. There’s definitely a little faith required on your part. This form of tension is knowing the Bible and seeing God’s work from Creation and knowing its culmination in Revelation. The tension is how we balance this knowledge with our understanding of God’s sovereignty and love.</p>

<p><strong>You can’t see the ground in front of you well enough to guarantee sure footing</strong> (Psalm 37:23). I can’t tell you how many times I almost rolled my ankles out there in the dark. I’m just thankful I’m not a horse, otherwise I’d have come up lame for sure. Isn’t this life, though? There are times when we’re more aware of the fact that we see the next step, but aren’t sure how safe it may be. I was at a heightened sense of awareness of this the entire run. The more concerned I became, the less I was trusting in God. And the less I trusted in God, the more I stumbled. Each step, we need God to ensure our footing, because our sight isn’t enough on its own as it is in the day.</p>

<p><strong>We know where we’re headed</strong> (John 14:2–4). Sometimes we get caught up in the here and now, so much so that we limit our perspective to that next step. That evening, I could keep looking over the hills seeing a light on the horizon knowing I was headed in that direction. Though I knew the trail (generally) very well, it provided guidance and hope. It also provided encouragement as I got closer. I always knew it was not far off, so it provided comfort as well. This is our knowledge of the glory of God. We know we are bound to share in it, but He gives us foretastes of it along the way and grace to keep us going and provide for our every need.</p>

<p><strong>We have to be ever vigilant in our journeys</strong> (1 Peter 5:8). Around each corner could be that hindrance that we don’t see coming because it didn’t have its lights on. It could come from the front or behind. It could be something we saw coming the whole way, but swerved a the last minute and wrought death and destruction on our souls. The danger is very present and very real. Just because we don’t see anything doesn’t mean nothing’s coming. Likewise, just because we see that something coming over the hill, doesn’t mean that by tracking it, we’ll be sure of avoiding it. It’s naive of us to think that we are either immune to all passing danger or that danger ceases to threaten us at some point. However, we have protection in a gracious and powerful God.</p>

<p>There is how I see life summed up in a run. It’s simple, but our understanding of the deeper truths is imperative. As Christians, we’ve been given a beginning and the end and it’s our job to live the middle faithfully devoting it to God. There is always danger around us and more often than not, we won’t see it before it is bearing down upon us. We alone are not enough to guarantee our own safety, but God can. He is both willing and able. Finally, no step is certain or secure. We need God each and every step of the way to establish us and keep us from stumbling. It’s not so complicated and we don’t need to make it so. As a result, we are called to love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control through the Spirit. <strong>Will we cast aside our insecurities and worries, trusting amidst the unknown in a faithful God, or will we try and wander alone in the dark</strong>?</p>

          <h2><a href="/life-of-paradox/">life of paradox</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>For the Christian, we live a life of paradox. We live constantly in the tension of what is and what is to come. I use the word tension, because I believe that within our very souls there should be two dueling realities that coalesce together to form our Christian worldview. However, their coexistence, the present reality and the coming, is a tightrope act that if walked alone has the propensity to crush us under the pressure.</p>

<p><strong>Know you will overcome, but accept the current reality</strong>. This is the <a href="http://www.ndoherty.com/stockdale-paradox/">Stockdale Paradox</a>. It was named after a Vietnam War veteran who spent eight years as a prisoner of war and was tortured about twenty times in that span. Living in this tension, Stockdale never cracked and other than the physical beatings he took, escaped with relatively little harm.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we shall certainly be united with him in a resurrection like his.” — Romans 6:5</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>We will overcome simply because Christ has</strong> <strong><em>already</em> overcome</strong>. That’s all there is to it. We are not merely called to optimism, but outright <em>confidence</em> in the words of Jesus when He told the disciples to find their peace in Him in the midst of trials as He had overcome the world (John 16:33). We have this very same guarantee which has been tattooed on our hearts and is the Holy Spirit. It is the seal of God’s covenant with us promising our forthcoming inheritance that we will surely receive (Ephesians 1:13–14).</p>

<p><strong>The here and now is broken</strong>. While there is beauty in this world, the overarching truth lies in the fact that our world has never been the same since the Garden of Eden. Once sin was introduced into the world, we humans have been just that, but nothing more. Once the effectors of God’s will, I find myself to be a rebel in the best of cases. And the world is filled with people like this. The world is not Heaven and it isn’t supposed to be now. However, this is not to be negative. This is not a dig, but merely perspective on the current situation. There is war, crime, poverty, hate and fear. This is just how the world should be that does not completely rely on the God of peace.</p>

<p><strong>No man is an island</strong>. I love Simon and Garfunkel, but their worldview was a crock. Even Stockdale in prison had a community that supported him and vice versa. Jesus was scarcely without His disciples. The apostles in prison were always creating a form of community with the other inmates and the guards. If they actively sought community wherever they went, then I cannot portend to be any more self-sufficient. We were always meant to live in community and to deny that need would undermine the rest of this philosophy. Without community, we have wasted precious time here as community provides the propping up which enables us to stumble our way together along the long and winding road of life.</p>

<p><strong>We will overcome though the current reality seems bleak</strong>. We have ample assurance from Jesus Himself that God has already triumphed; now, it is our opportunity to <em>join</em> in that victory. That victory is over sin which so pervades this world that our reality is one of brokenness and pain. Life is not misery, but there is plenty of pain in the midst of those plateaus of happiness. Finally, our reality and reality to come are meant to be taken on with others because alone we are too weak. We need others so that we may <em>all</em> stand upright. Friend, there’s a lot of work to be done and we all need one another’s help. How about living today in Christ’s victory, so that we can make our present a little better and we can all enjoy it <em>together</em>?</p>

          <h2><a href="/joys-gone-missing/">joy’s gone missing</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>I couldn’t tell you when it occurred, but joy’s gone missing. It was last seen as a fruit of the Spirit, but I see no trace today. Honestly, I’m not surprised, but It’s still very saddening. Sure, joy doesn’t fit in with the American dream or name it and claim it. Sure, joy’s a threat to our culture’s attitude of incessant progress and work mentality. However, disappearance seems drastic, especially since joy is so misunderstood.</p>

<p>I’ll admit, <strong>joy is subversive</strong>. Joy throws out our knowledge of situations and circumstances and teaches us something completely different. Joy comes from peace which is something we strive for but aren’t really supposed to attain until we retire because it could hurt our competitive nature as well as our drive. Joy changes relationships as well. Basically, joy takes a life and turns it upside down. Or did we know that already?</p>

<p>Joy doesn’t care about your circumstances. Sorry to be so blunt, but it doesn’t. Joy is something that can be present in young and old, rich and poor, healthy and sick. Even the rich made poor and the healthy made sick are not able to escape the guile of joy. In fact, it is often in the midst of hardship that joy begins work. It is in the worst of circumstances where joy takes root and begins to change a once normal person.</p>

<p><strong>Joy isn’t happiness</strong>. There are so many times that I’ve heard people use joy when referring to happiness. I understand the confusion, but there is a marked difference that people need to understand. Happy isn’t dangerous. Happy doesn’t change people, turn heads or show up when uninvited. Joy does all these things and more. Joy definitely changes people. It does turn heads as anyone who’s seen a joyful person will agree. You can’t forget that person as the entire interaction you feel intrinsically something is off, different. Joy often shows up in places where happiness doesn’t belong. Grief, pain, illness, etc. are no place for happiness, but somehow joy seems to be incubated. This joy cannot be happiness.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“‘Truly, truly, I say to you, you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice. You will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will turn into joy. When a woman is giving birth, she has sorrow because her hour has come, but when she has delivered the baby, she no longer remembers the anguish, for joy that a human being has been born into the world. So also you have sorrow now, but I will see you again, and your hearts will rejoice, and no one will take your joy from you. In that day you will ask nothing of me. Truly, truly, I say to you, whatever you ask of the Father in my name, he will give it to you. Until now you have asked nothing in my name. Ask, and you will receive, that your joy may be full.’” — John 16:20–24</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Jesus is the source of joy</strong>. Why do we seek life among the dead here? If we are looking for joy, then we must find a source that is equally unchanging. One of the greatest radicals who ever lived is the only place where joy can be found. Joy was always meant to challenge what the world thinks normal. But, Jesus wants it for us. He wants us to exemplify this difference, but what He really wants out of this for us is to understand through it how much He loves us and how good He is. Joy, therefore, is an acknowledgment of His sovereignty and a constant rejoicing in that fact.</p>

<p>Despite Jesus’ intentions, joy’s gone missing. I don’t see it in me and I don’t see it much around me. It gets confused often for happiness, much to its chagrin. But, joy is far from happiness and that was always how God intended it to be. So, let’s let joy be itself and accept it for that. Once we do that, it’s time to go looking for joy. However, it’s not much of a search. We know where to find it. Once we do, we can’t be afraid to hold on.</p>

          <h2><a href="/the-difference-is-grace/">the difference is grace</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>The problem I see with us Christians today is we don’t seem to care what makes us unique; the difference is <em>grace</em>. Sure, there are several nuances unique to each religion and each denomination within each respective religion, however there is only <em>one</em> eight hundred pound gorilla in the room. The only difference I can see that amounts to anything is <em>grace</em>, but it doesn’t seem like that’s terribly important when we’re on the giving end.</p>

<p>The best definition I’ve heard of grace is love in action. If we want a clearer working definition, we have the life, death and resurrection of Jesus that was the perfect embodiment of what grace looks like. What I see in this is that grace can hurt. I hate to break it to you, but the Bible is filled with plenty of examples of people being killed or dealt with poorly while showing grace to the perpetrator(s). However, grace is our <em>duty</em> and <em>responsibility</em> (Romans 6:14). Let’s not deceive ourselves into thinking that the life of the faithful believer is filled with health, wealth and prosperity here.</p>

<p>We are called in light of this to bring life, which God has brought us into, to the world and the lives around us. Here is the thing, however, there is no middle ground with grace. If we are not definitively bringing life into a situation, then we are contributing (willfully or apathetically) to its death. If grace is truly love in action, then bringing life into the world around us means <em>acting</em> in love regardless of the circumstances, not in <em>spite</em> of the circumstances. It is <em>exemplifying</em> Christ to everyone around without concern for how it looks or what is acceptable. Grace is counter-cultural. It was always meant to be, so let’s not try to make it vogue or attractive. That is merely kindness.</p>

<p><strong>Grace is accepting the hurt, regardless of intention, of an action or situation and reciprocating love.</strong> I mentioned grace can hurt and I know from experience that it will at times. However, this is precisely what makes it radical. Grace, if it were easy, would negate the need for goodness in this world (I don’t know about you, but we could use a lot more goodness.) Faith would merely be an exercise taught in preschool like sharing and waiting in line. <strong>Grace is not cheap</strong>. In fact, it is the most expensive gift we can give in this life.</p>

<p>Most importantly, grace only comes from God (2 John 1:3). It seems this is where the communication breakdown occurs. The origin of grace is most prominently witnessed by Jesus’ well-known cry out to God, “Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.” (Luke 23:24) Grace is a supernatural ability to deny <em>every</em> human impulse of revenge, justice and fairness and instead repay iniquity with blessing. It is beyond me to dismiss ill unfairly dumped upon me by a stranger, much more so by a loved one, and choose instead to return the favor with grace. However, it is not my responsibility to produce grace, because God knew my heart and tendencies from the beginning. How much has God showered me with grace up to today? How much more so will He when I ask to be empowered to share the overflow with others. Jesus said, “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind, and your neighbor as yourself,” and this is the perfect way to do so.</p>

<p>The difference is <em>grace</em>, because it is not a human response and is therefore meant to stand out in this world by nature, but we’ve dreadfully lost sight of this fact. Rather than put our faith in action, we settle for proclaiming articulate words of faith that fall empty with a lack of substance. It seems we are afraid of rolling up our sleeves and getting dirty with the visceral and real people around us. We are somehow afraid of sharing this life we’ve been given in <em>abundance</em>, maybe because we don’t understand it ourselves, I’m not sure. Whatever the cause, there is a critical disconnect. Finally, we don’t seek grace from the source. Because of the unattractiveness, effort and pain that is inherent in showing grace, we don’t think to ask for it from the Father. How selfish can we be? <strong>If grace which we have accepted through faith is the greatest gift we have received, how wicked do we have to be to deny granting it to others?</strong></p>

          <h2><a href="/just-reflections/">just reflections</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>I was talking with a good friend last night and we got to talking about reflections. We were talking on the phone and her dog started barking at her mirror and we concluded he must be barking at his own reflection. Then we began thinking about how difficult it is to understand the concept of a reflection and how the only way we understood was by wiser adults explaining it to us. Her dog obviously did not have someone to explain it to him. And I now wonder if I and we as a whole truly appreciate what we see in our own reflections.</p>

<p>First and foremost, our reflection represents how we perceive ourselves. Think about it, we have no physical concept of ourselves outside of what we see in our reflections. It is a representation of what we see in ourselves and how we value and maintain that. Our reflection is the first impression of who I am and how I’m feeling most mornings as I’m shuffling about the house in a sleepy daze. However, I see it everyday (I’d say that’s true for most of us) and so I don’t pay much attention to it anymore.</p>

<p>Reflections are also the way others perceive us and vice versa. We meet people everyday and the first metric we use in determining our impression of them is how they look. Women are amazing at this, as the description is almost excruciatingly detailed, but it is nothing more than our reflection. While this makes sense, it’s not something I take into consideration often enough. Our reflection can mean the difference between a deep, meaningful conversation and a brushing over. We don’t need to let this hinder others’ impressions of us when our lives are meant to be social.</p>

<p>Reflections go deeper and provide a window into our souls. We’re going deep here and our reflections provide the tip of that iceberg. A reflection can tell whether someone is rejoicing or brokenhearted. Our reflections give subtle clues about what is important to us in the deepest levels. They provide hints about where we are spiritually and emotionally. However, we need to be mindful of what we are shining this daylight.</p>

<p>No, I’m not saying that we need to solely focus on the exterior, but highlighting the fact that what is inside will manifest itself in our external. If we are trying to carry the message of the Gospel, people must first incur our exteriors before they can get a real picture of what is inside our hearts. So, in that case, why should we be ignorant in our hindering the spreading of this good news? When you look at yourself and when others look at you they should see a heart sold to the Savior of the world.</p>

<p>Reflections are far more telling than we think, even down to what is in our souls. They provide to others a glimpse of what is inside as a manifestation on our exterior. Reflections also show our self-perception and worth. If a significant majority of the information we take in is visual, shouldn’t we be more concerned with this as messengers of Jesus Christ’s salvation?</p>

<p><strong>When people look at you, when you look at you, is it Christ that is seen and His work in your life, or do they just see another person confused like the rest?</strong></p>

          <h2><a href="/enough-is-enough-6d7c5e9e47e/">enough is enough</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>I hope no one reading thinks at this point that I’m immune to the problems common to the rest of mankind, because you’d be utterly mistaken. I had a couple friends visit from out of town this past weekend and despite having a great weekend, when they were getting ready to leave I wanted more time. It was like the rest of the weekend didn’t matter. All I cared about was getting more. This is just a small example, but if we’re honest with ourselves we <em>always</em> want more.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Sheol and Abaddon are never satisfied, and never satisfied are the eyes of man.” — Proverbs 27:20</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m not saying anyone is unique in this desire, nor am I saying indulging it is in our best interest either. Our hearts are <em>constantly</em> in search of contentment and for us, the most logical thing is to feed it money, power, possessions, pleasure, and the list goes on. You may choose to disagree at this juncture, but what good do all these do us? I have never heard of a person contented in any one of these things, so why should I expect to be?</p>

<p>How can we appreciate light without darkness, warmth without cold or love without bitterness? Likewise, without adversity I don’t know how I could ever fully appreciate God’s goodness to me. It is the times of drought and famine in my life (metaphorically speaking) that make the times of abundance so joyous. Without darkness, how can I know just how <em>bright</em> is God’s light? I cannot.</p>

<p>Unintentionally, this message is very timely for a nation that has been lulled into complacency by an extended period of prosperity. We here in America have had more <em>always</em> available to us and so we have been able to stuff our proverbial faces with all that we see solely occupying ourselves with the pursuit. We’ve never had to step back and examine the state of things until now when more is not as available financially as we have gotten used to it being. Now that we can’t <em>buy</em> more, how else do we satisfy our ravenous desires?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“’Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.’” — Matthew 11:28–29</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is one way to satisfy the desires of the heart and that is with the spiritual contentment that can only be supplied by Jesus. Never has greater love been shown than in His life, death and resurrection. However, after resurrection, Jesus (unlike everyone else in history) never died again. If He can save Himself (no small feat) and live indefinitely, don’t you think He can at least save you as well?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“‘I have said these things to you, that in me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation. But take heart; I have overcome the world.’” — John 16:33</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You see that we were never promised a life without pain and trials, but those do not afflict our heart. While it feels like they do, this world is only temporal and cannot affect the eternal. When we place our full trust in Christ as our Savior <em>and</em> Sustainer, we choose the <em>more</em> for which our hearts are desperately crying out. We choose to feed ourselves with food meant for our heart, a heart which cannot be alive in the first place unless it receives this specific kind of nurturing. In other words, he brings our hearts to life for the first time. However, we still need those cuts and bruises along the way to remind us that we are alive and how good that life is.</p>

<p>I know it is all too easy for me to complain about the times when I am left wanting more of something, but God knows that giving me more would only produce a vicious cycle. Instead, He is pointing me toward Himself, the only thing that can sate the deeper desires of my heart that manifest themselves in my desiring physical things when spiritual are not provided. However, if I settle for the physical, I will only be disappointed in what I have and left in the cold wanting for more. Rather than complaining in our droughts, let’s rejoice that we are not left without at all. While the <em>things</em> we desire are in shorter supply, our God is abundant in His love and graciousness and that is what we really <em>need</em> after all.</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p>I’m in the middle of a startling revelation that I’d rather not deal with right now. It’s not that it’s biting or cutting to my core (actually scratch that thought, it is), but really it’s just a further awakening to the reality in which I prefer not to live. In case any of you wondered, yes, I dream of the day when I see and envy the statistics and abilities of blogs like <a href="http://donmilleris.com/">Don Miller’s</a>, <a href="http://www.jonacuff.com/blog/">Jon Acuff’s</a> and the like. But, the startling reality is the fact that I am where I am for a reason. Moreover, those blogs aren’t <em>me</em>; they’re not my race, my purpose.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight, and sin which clings so closely, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us, looking to Jesus, the founder and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is seated at the right hand of the throne of God. Consider him who endured from sinners such hostility against himself, so that you may not grow weary or fainthearted.” — Hebrews 12:1–3</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I mentioned earlier this week that I do most of my thinking in the car and before I fall asleep, but I have one more to add to that list as I realized while working out that I (and I suspect <em>most</em>) have a problem with being quiet in my soul. It seems that everything about life is go, go, go and do, do, do. Even my prayer life, which <em>should</em> be a rather quiet segment of life, is filled with me asking for things and trying to fill the “dead space.” I realize that I have a very difficult time just calming down and letting the world pass me by in a sense. I have a problem letting go subconsciously of the idea that time is money. If it were, I would have to be at least slightly richer than trying to save money living with my parents right now.</p>

<p>This is a major problem, if not the <em>sole</em> reason, in my desire to understand God’s purpose for my life. I feel we’re significantly handicapped by our fast-paced lifestyles because being still and quiet, waiting for God’s quiet whispers in the dark doesn’t translate…<em>at all</em>. No, I’m not really sure of the race God’s laid out before me, but I can’t imagine I’d understand any better if God yelled it out to me. I’m not listening and I don’t know how. I wish He could just give me the words so I could hear myself speak it, but I haven’t found it to work that way so far.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I am the war inside.<br />
I am the battle line.<br />
I am the rising tide.<br />
I am the war I fight.<br />
Eyes open, open wide.<br />
I can feel it like a crack in my spine.<br />
I can feel it like the back of my mind.<br />
I am the war inside.<br />

</blockquote>

<p>I feel like a broken record, but I can’t say it enough. We are our own greatest enemies. We struggle with purpose in our lives because the life we know doesn’t know how to slow down. However, we need to so we can stop and listen. Otherwise, we are merely buoys floating out in the middle of the ocean with no direction and no landmarks to give a relative location. We have a glorious and divine purpose, but it’s up to us to fulfill it. What are you doing today to quiet your world and listen for it?</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p>I’m going to let you in a little on my writing process. I come up with several topics throughout each week, but forget most by the time I get the opportunity to write them down. In other words, I do most of my thinking commuting to or from work or before I’m going to sleep. However, this week was a marked departure from that norm. I had an idea of what this post was going to be and then I went to church at Reston Bible Church. I realized something about myself that I feel is applicable for most.</p>

<p>Life is rarely fulfilling. That’s merely a fact inherent of life on earth. Life isn’t meant to be easy, but for most of us it’s rather painful (John 16:33). Honestly, life doesn’t meet my expectations. I get overwhelmed by the plethora of choices and information which is available on a daily basis. I am so stimulated by all the noise around me that I do not know how I am to go about running the race God has created me to run. There is just so much to deal with that I often shut down and choose not to deal with any of it.</p>

<p>I don’t know about you, but my expectation of life is <em>never</em> met. I’m an optimist and so most of the time I’m looking for my circumstances to resemble the fairy tale ending, but that isn’t how God works. When I try to adjust my expectations, God goes and blows them out of the water. I never know what to expect, but I can guarantee by now my expectations are only setting me up for disappointment. That is precisely the result. Rather than look at God’s word, I selfishly form my own expectations and expect God to work within that small box.</p>

<p>I feel this is odd from an IT professional, but I become increasingly numbed each day by the overload of information and choices our society affords. There is simply <em>too</em> much noise with which I’m bombarded daily and my reaction is to tune it all out (or at least as much as I can). In the same way, I also tune out the wisdom of God. Instead of retreating into His tender loving care, I run into my own hole and just play dead. I choose apathy and ferment in my own foolishness.</p>

<p>In case you’re wondering, <em>I</em> don’t have any better clue of God’s purpose for my life than <em>you</em>. And that realization is scary. It makes me want to run and hide in hopes that when I return to life all will be spelled out perfectly for me. Despite my fear, I know this to be absolutely ridiculous. I know God has a great purpose for my life, but my inhibitions are so convincing. No, I don’t want to put myself out there. I don’t want to choose to pursue God’s will for my life, because it’s not safe. How can I be sure that He’ll provide for me in the future?</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p><strong>Truth be told, I’m dead inside</strong>. Being alive in Christ involves a <em>great</em> deal of risk, the very risk that terrifies me on a daily basis. Maybe I’m not scared outright, but it is a daily choice, living, that I need to make but am not. As a writer, I’m failing you my reader. I am a hypocrite telling you to run the race well which you were created to run, while <em>walking</em> along my own course (1 Corinthians 9:24). This life isn’t going to magically get better; it was never meant to. Instead, we were meant to change our perceptions and expectations to what God provides for us in His word. Maybe I’m a stupid 23-year-old, but I firmly believe we can do all things to which God calls us, regardless of how clear He makes His intentions to us (Philippians 4:13). So, do we choose risk in living a life devoted fully to loving the God who loved us first this week? Well…do we?</p>

          <h2><a href="/dying-to-live/">dying to live</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>I was journaling during a quiet time this week when the thought struck me. I’ve realized I’m in somewhat of a transitional period in my life and somewhere along the line, I’ve reasoned that it’s OK, <em>best</em> even, to put my life on a hold. How does one do this? Very simply. I’ve somehow convinced myself not to get too involved and invested in the community around me because I’m going to be moving soon and I don’t want the abrupt end of those relationships and connections caused by my inevitable moving. And moving is definitely the goal as I’m currently living with my parents, saving money so I can afford a place of my own (with roommates, of course).</p>

<p>I now understand how many people can come to hate their jobs and even their lives. It only takes the reasoning, “I’ll only do this for a little while,” and then the person wakes up half a lifetime later living a life characterized by the settling that they assured themselves was temporary. The danger in settling, not seeking God’s joy in every aspect of our lives is that it’s contagious. It is a disease that starts with our interactions with friends and family, for instance, and then spreads its way into our very souls. Most of the time, when people begin to understand what has happened, their little, harmless settling has matured into a full-grown apathy. This is soul poisoning because something is most definitely wrong, but since settling is all that is known, there is little to no effort in changing the situation; these people become captives in their own bodies.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“No I’m not alright<br />
I know that I’m not right<br />
A steering wheel don’t mean you can drive<br />
A warm body don’t mean I’m alive<br />
No I’m not alright<br />
I know that I’m not right<br />
Feels like I travel but I never arrive<br />
I want to thrive not just survive”<br />
“Thrive” — Switchfoot</p>
</blockquote>

<p>God is ironic, because the same morning I had this revelation I was listening to the new <a href="http://www.switchfoot.com/switchfoot/c/index-b">Switchfoot album</a> on my way to work and the song “Thrive” stood out to me. Just look at the chorus (above) and you see a picture of a man who’s struggling with this very same problem. However, there is a realization here that I feel is often overlooked. Reading slightly into the lyrics, I think it’s safe to say that Jon Foreman understands that his desire to thrive is the result of his God-given design. We were made to thrive, but somewhere along the way we’ve all been told that it’s OK to settle for survival. This is a travesty.</p>

<p>The worst thing about being a Christian and struggling with this is being able to reason a subsistence lifestyle with the promises of the greatness of heaven. I can’t count how many times I or someone else has responded to struggle with some form of the “treasure in heaven” adage. While there is great truth in this, we’ve decontextualized it in a dangerous fashion. Heaven will be amazing. However, my dad last week helped me to realize this past week as we stood looking out over the valley at the sunset that there is so much beauty here and now. While heaven will be…indescribable, our existences here are not lived for a minute without God’s grace raining down on us. The real difference between this life and heaven, must be the fact that in heaven God does not have to use evil events to manifest His good will. Instead, in heaven all is good and beautiful, made whole again.</p>

<p>The fact of the matter is that we have accepted the highest calling in the universe and it’s to be lived out here on earth. That calling is one devoid of apathy and settling, but is not to be confused with selfishness. We were created for a purpose and that is what what brings our souls to life. Have you ever seen a soul aflame? It’s a scary experience, because this person is so foreign and their liveliness is infectious. It’s really uncomfortable to the apathetic, because the soul alive is active and comfortable with <a href="http://104.193.143.57/~waywar13/ce/2011/09/23/risky-business/">risk</a>. So, it’s up to us. Will we settle to die before we’re ready to live or will we daily make the <a href="http://104.193.143.57/~waywar13/ce/2011/09/26/the-choice/%20‎">choice</a> to live out our God-given purpose? Maybe the better question to ask is in what areas are you settling today?</p>

          <h2><a href="/the-choice/">the choice</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>I woke up this morning and admittedly felt rather lackluster about beginning a new week. I believe the rest of the country would refer to this as the common <a href="http://104.193.143.57/~waywar13/ce/2011/09/13/cure-for-the-mondays/">Case of the Mondays</a>. However, when you’re relatively optimistic, waking up like this is startling to say the least. On top of the normal trauma induced by the violent rousing from sleep that is waking up to an alarm clock, it’s nigh unbearable. As I was ambling about the house in a fog rivaling that outside, I remembered yesterday’s <a href="http://www.restonbible.org/sermons/item/385-the-enemy-within">sermon</a> at Reston Bible Church.</p>

<p>Today, like every day, represents an important choice. The choice we face is the same each day, but our answer, certainly mine, does not always follow the same path. Being human, we have a distinct capacity for both good and evil, the latter I feel being markedly easier to pursue. However, it is this very decision made consciously each day that defines us. It is the recognition that, each day, this decision is independent of every other decision we’ve made in our lives, but it is just as important if not more so.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“For I do not understand my own actions. For I do not do what I want, but I do the very thing I hate.” — Romans 7:15</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The words here of Paul sum up our great capacity to achieve evil. I think we can all agree that Paul was one of the greatest Christians to have ever lived, yet he admitted to struggling mightily with his baser nature. The danger here is that it is all too easy to make this decision, especially when we do not intentionally go about its opposite.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://www.needtobreathe.net/music/3e97e0-the-reckoning/">The Reckoning — Needtobreathe</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I turned on this song as I was driving to work this morning and I think it gives an idea of what choosing to pursue good in this world looks like. It is <em>not</em> an easy choice. There will <em>always</em> be hindrances and obstacles. Most importantly, we <em>can’t</em> do it on our own. I’m sorry, but I can’t do a <em>thing</em> without some ulterior motive tarnishing what looks on the outside to be good. I realize now that only God can work in my heart to produce true, unadulterated goodness (Romans 7:18).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Now if I do what I do not want, it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells within me. So I find it to be a law that when I want to do right, evil lies close at hand. For I delight in the law of God, in my inner being,but I see in my members another law waging war against the law of my mind and making me captive to the law of sin that dwells in my members. Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from this body of death? Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I myself serve the law of God with my mind, but with my flesh I serve the law of sin.” Romans 7:20–25</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are plenty of examples of <em>good</em> people doing <em>evil</em>, in fact the Bible is filled with them. The great King David, praised as a man after God’s heart, committed adultery, murder and nearly every other sin under the sun. His son, the wise King Solomon, worshipped other gods among other things. The vilified Judas Iscariot, I feel I need to clarify, was a disciple of Jesus and could not therefore have been a purely evil man. Judas made one poor decision that was followed by another of greater consequence and then realized he could not take either back. An evil man does not hang himself in shame after committing evil. Herein lies the crux of the matter.</p>

<p>Today, we stand on the precipice of a great and consequential decision. While it is independent of every previous decision we’ve made, its consequences have eternal impact. Do we accept easy and do what comes most naturally to us? Or, do we rely on God to work in and through us and face together the inevitable hardship of opposing our flesh? Remember God’s grace as you contemplate. Your decision yesterday is as far as the east is from the west. Let’s choose wisely, but the fact is, we <em>need</em> to make a choice.</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p>I had a bit of a startling revelation today that cut me to the core and I’m still reeling as I type this. As much as I may think of myself as bold and risk-taking, I’m a pansy. I say this because I feel I don’t truly understand and appreciate the true meaning of risk.</p>

<p>Risk is precisely what we love about every great movie hero that I can remember. Each hero did not risk a little, nor did they risk a lot; they risked <em>everything</em>. I think cognitively we understand this concept as noble and even necessary for a hero. Any hero risking all to save their loved ones, stand up for what is right, do good of any sort is exalted in this country, yet I feel there is a disconnect.</p>

<p>Calling myself a Christian means that I am following Christ and placing my identity in that pursuit. It should mean that in so identifying, I am betting the farm on Jesus being the way, the truth and the life (John 14:6). It should mean that everything I am and everything I have is committed to this end. I fear that this is merely an “ought” and not a reality.</p>

<p>Why this is true, I think, lies in the fact that I have not (and I suspect many others also haven’t) had to risk much in my life. Risking everything to me means putting my life savings into a venture that may not pan out in the end. Sure, this is risking a lot, but theoretically I could go and get a job and at least eke out a living if I go broke. Risk is not just monetary, nor is it only relational. Risk here encompasses <em>everything</em> from our finances to our reputations to our very souls. Daily, I feel I take this fact very lightly, or even ignore it altogether.</p>

<p>Maybe I’m wrong and the cause is the fact that we don’t fully understand what is the purpose for our taking on risk. To this possibility, my only response is, “Duh!” I’m sorry, but we’re not supposed to fully understand God and the reward we have through the death and resurrection of Christ that is waiting for us at the end of this road! That seems like it must be the point. The reward, part of which is God, the ultimate Being in the universe, saying, “Well done, good and faithful servant,” which in and of itself I cannot fathom (Matthew 25:21). For what we are risking is so great that words will never describe and that is all we need to understand.</p>

<p>Our calling is a means of living out an existence risked completely for the One in whom we find our identity. I admit, I’ve been weak in this area and for that I apologize. I have been holding back and no one in that scenario truly benefits. We’re not meant to be half-hearted, yet I understand that draw to being so. I myself recognize it and vow to work against it.</p>

<p>Friend, we were created to accomplish great and unimaginable things. However, we can’t do it alone and we certainly can’t do it with a heart divided. The only way we can possibly succeed is to sell out to our Savior and Sustainer. We must live wholly for Him doing what He created us specifically to do and to the best of our God-given ability. I’m not seeing it. I know mine, but what’s your excuse?</p>

          <h2><a href="/what-is-persecution/">what is persecution?</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>I’d consider myself to be rather confident in my faith (for only being 23), but I have to admit there are some things in the Bible that I just can’t seem to make sense of in today’s society. For example, why do we have toenails? But seriously, one of the most perplexing for me is the idea of <em>persecution</em>. Sure, I know <em>cognitively</em> what the word means, but I have no <em>contextual</em> comprehension for what that looks like in today’s American culture. What does being ostracized in some way for my faith look like here?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“‘If the world hates you, know that it has hated me before it hated you. If you were of the world, the world would love you as its own; but because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you. Remember the word that I said to you: “A servant is not greater than his master.” If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you. If they kept my word, they will also keep yours. But all these things they will do to you on account of my name, because they do not know him who sent me. If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have been guilty of sin, but now they have no excuse for their sin. Whoever hates me hates my Father also. If I had not done among them the works that no one else did, they would not be guilty of sin, but now they have seen and hated both me and my Father. But the word that is written in their Law must be fulfilled: “They hated me without a cause.”” — John 15:18–25</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In a society that is infatuated with celebrities, that is precisely what the overtly persecuted become here, a <em>celebrity</em>. The persecuted are quickly transformed into the symbol of those seeking refuge in the safe haven of the US and are catapulted into a myth-like category of demi-god and rallying cry. Simply put, persecution doesn’t work at all the same way it did back in the early centuries of the Church (Acts). Rather than being a trial, it serves to exult the persecuted individual and so we don’t see it very much here.</p>

<p>At the same time, I cannot fathom a country free from bigotry and discrimination as they both seem consistent with my perceptions of the human condition. I’m not calling everyone a <em>bigot</em>, nor am I calling them <em>prejudiced</em>, but I know those few are out there no matter where you go. What does this form of marginalization look like, though? Am I merely fabricating its existence just to prolong the publication of this blog? Could it be that I’m out of material and refuse to recycle an old post?</p>

<p>To be honest, I can’t rule out either of those latter questions, but I feel there’s a much more important question to be asked at this juncture. Assuming persecution really is a very rare case here, could that be because we as Christians are living a life that serves to self-persecute?</p>

<p>Oftentimes, I feel like I am so self-conscious of my own faith that I marginalize myself. I am crippled by the perceptions of others that I subjugate my essential rights and freedoms to their possible negative reactions. I beat myself down mentally before they have a chance to do so themselves in some form.</p>

<p>Conversely, I also judge many based on some made up set of guidelines so that I can boost my self-image. I do this so that I can counteract my own self-consciousness before it has a chance to cut <em>me</em> down. Basically, my own insecurity in who I am and, more importantly, who that person is in my Savior, Jesus, pushes me to diminish others and persecuted lest they subvert my preemption. This alone is substantial evidence for me to believe that this shortcoming is reason enough for me to not need to undergo persecution for my faith to be tested.</p>

<p>Of course, these are merely <em>my</em> thoughts, but thoughts that express a confusion with the Biblical idea of facing persecution for our faith. It must be out there <em>somewhere</em> in this country, but it’s very difficult to find. I can’t think of a single example where someone has truly been ostracized or mocked for their belief in Jesus, let alone <em>beaten</em>. Therefore I turn to you, my friend. Where do you see persecution in America? Am I that blind? Do we seem to preempt any persecution with the manifestation of our insecurities? Or, could it just be that we Christians persecute those around us enough to have turned everyone else off the taste of blood, if you will?</p>

          <h2><a href="/september-11/">september 11</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>I’m just going to come right out and say that today’s post is totally about September 11th. I’m a pretty big football fan and being the first weekend of the season, I wasn’t about to miss a minute of action if I could help it. Another thing I couldn’t miss was the tribute the NFL paid to the tenth anniversary of the September 11th attacks. Over the past several days, I haven’t been able to help myself but to keep wrestling with the tribute itself as well as my thoughts on the decade past.</p>

<p>I have to say, the tribute sponsored by the NFL before the Jets vs. Cowboys game was <em>absolutely</em> moving. I was in tears throughout, only stifled by my awareness of my father’s presence on the couch next to me. The message delivered by Robert De Niro was well written and the playing of Amazing Grace instantly threw whatever composure I had left right over the large falls of my heart. It was absolutely beautiful and I believe it was an appropriate offering of gratitude to those who died that day. Within an instant, this pristine moment was <em>ruined</em>.</p>

<p>I love this country and feel more than blessed to have lived my entire life here, but the chants of “U-S-A, U-S-A” that followed utterly ruined the moment. While September 11th was undeniably an attack on the United States of America and we as a country lost a lot on that day and as a result of that day, I find it truly has little to do with our country. If we are to keep our focus on such a minute piece of the greater whole, then we choose ignorance and miss the grander, infinitely more beautiful picture on display.</p>

<p>Keeping the focus on our country, I see a lot of ugliness ten years later. I see a country gripped with <em>fear</em> and <em>hatred</em>. I see <em>paranoia</em>. I see <em>helplessness</em> and <em>desperation</em>. No, I don’t see much good coming from those events of ten years ago. We as a nation have merely mourned our dead and waged a shadow war on terrorism using the very tactics we despise. As a country, we are hypocrites looking down on other nations when we prove constantly we are no better than they. I understand there are things I’m overlooking here, but please bear with me.</p>

<p>I don’t know about you, but this outlook doesn’t sit well with me at all and so I’m forced to look elsewhere. In this search, I had to recognize that God was still sovereign on September 11th ten years ago. I’ve seen that He’s had a purpose in all of this, but what precisely that is I’m not sure. However, I do know that He does have a purpose in all this and I know He is good. This should say something and indeed it does.</p>

<p>C.S. Lewis said that pain is God’s megaphone, grabbing our attention when His gentle whispers cannot. September 11th definitely got our attention, but have we really learned anything as a result? Honestly, I don’t know, but here are some thoughts.</p>

<p>First, <strong>life is fleeting</strong>. We don’t have time to waste, because we don’t know when our lives will be required of us. We don’t know for sure the sun will rise in the morning. I don’t know if anyone will ever read this post. We don’t need to be panicked, but we need to live with an urgency and a purpose. We were designed to live this way.</p>

<p><strong>All things on this earth are fleeting</strong>, but love which is from God will <em>never</em> die. The greatest power in this universe is love. We all know this deep down, but it is so easy to leave buried beneath a world of haste and stress. The Beatles were right when they said that love is all we need. They were merely paraphrasing Jesus when He said the greatest command was to love God and love our neighbors. But, how much of a priority is this for us?</p>

<p>Lastly, to keep this brief, <em>this life was never meant to be lived solely beneath the sun</em>. We are so contented with the <em>futility</em> and <em>tension</em> inherent in this existence, but there is far more to be had if we only take a moment each day and stop solely living in the physical realm. It’s only then that we can see all the good that God is doing and has done through the more than ten years now since September 11th. God has brought so much beauty into this world by drawing people to Himself, but this doesn’t translate on the physical or national levels. Life lived for God reveals the true silver lining of the attacks. The most evil of intentions used in spite of themselves for the ultimate good. This is <em>beautiful</em>.</p>

<p>You may disagree, but September 11th did little, if <em>any</em>, good for this country. We awoke briefly from a complacent slumber, but sunk back into a paranoia-induced coma. September 11th was never meant to be about this country. It was never meant to be about anything on this earth. Instead, the attacks were about what the rest of history has been pointing us towards. God’s grace, mercy and glory are all too evident now, just as they were ten years ago. You simply need to know where to look and it isn’t in the American flag. It’s in the cross; in the blood shed two milennia ago so that we could be freed from all this once and for all. Ten years after September 11th, are we living as <em>free</em> Americans or just Americans?</p>

            <p>I have to admit, it’s easy to love Mondays when you’re not working. They, like every other day of the week, are merely Saturdays and <em>everyone</em> loves Saturday. Now that I’ve been working a couple weeks, I’ve come to find that I have joined the rest of the working world in considering Monday to be the most dreaded and loathed day of the week. However, <em>my</em> reasons for doing so are different from most.</p>

<p>I don’t like Mondays because it means that I have to listen to everyone with a “case of the Mondays” proclaim their intense detest for this most unfortunate day of the week. I’m new in the office, so I don’t feel comfortable slaying their Monday dragons with my sword of optimism, but I’m really questioning this passive approach. However, as much as I’d like to gripe about the immediate problem, I know there is a far deeper cause to the rampant Monday-ragging.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Formerly, when you did not know God, you were enslaved to those that by nature are not gods. But now that you have come to know God, or rather to be known by God, how can you turn back again to the weak and worthless elementary principles of the world, whose slaves you want to be once more? You observe days and months and seasons and years!” — Galatians 4:8–10</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I hate to even hypothesize this, but have we become so enslaved to our lives and happiness that we have forgotten <em>every</em> day is a precious gift from God? Each sunrise is invaluable regardless of our to-do list for the day. Our schedule has no weight on our souls. Do we truly revile our daily occupations so much that not a Monday can pass without us voicing our complaints? This is far from the joy our merciful Lord has in store for us.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Ascribe to the LORD, O heavenly beings, ascribe to the LORD glory and strength. Ascribe to the LORD the glory due his name; worship the LORD in the splendor of holiness. The voice of the LORD is over the waters; the God of glory thunders, the LORD, over many waters. The voice of the LORD is powerful; the voice of the LORD is full of majesty. The voice of the LORD breaks the cedars; the LORD breaks the cedars of Lebanon. He makes Lebanon to skip like a calf, and Sirion like a young wild ox. The voice of the LORD flashes forth flames of fire. The voice of the LORD shakes the wilderness; the LORD shakes the wilderness of Kadesh. The voice of the LORD makes the deer give birth and strips the forests bare, and in his temple all cry, ‘Glory!’ The LORD sits enthroned over the flood; the LORD sits enthroned as king forever. May the LORD give strength to his people! May the LORD bless his people with peace!” — Psalm 29</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.relevantmagazine.com/sons-daughters/songs/25402-your-glory">This</a> is what our Monday should look like, friends. However, we have contented ourselves with a joy in God that…well, is non-existent. What has overtaken the surpassing beauty of our God? God is greater, more beautiful and more gracious than any affliction or trial we may endure. The light of His glory is brighter than any darkness our souls may encounter. Sadly, you would never know this from looking at any of us on Mondays. It’s such a shame we so dread this wonderful gift from the Gracious One. Be it work, school, unemployment, whatever, it is a gift meant to draw us closer to a God who we could never approach without His drawing <em>us</em> near to Himself. <strong>And He’s doing just that</strong>!</p>

<p><em>How far from grace do we fall on Mondays</em>! I’m not sure what has so eclipsed our joy in the Maker, but it comes around like clockwork at the beginning of each work week. Yet, God is the same all <em>seven</em> days of the week, otherwise He would not have created them all. Who am <em>I</em> to say God’s grace is less valuable or simply less abundant on Mondays. For that matter, who are <em>you</em>? Seriously, <strong>who are we on Mondays</strong>?</p>

            <p>For those unaware, it’s been raining rather consistently here at least for the past week. However, yesterday was different. I don’t mean different in that it didn’t rain; in fact, it rained even more than usual. I mean different in that as I was driving home from work, standing water forcefully spraying up on either side as I crawled along, I don’t know what happened but I ceased to be in traffic anymore. There was no longer a single car around me. Instead, I was merely driving through puddles trying to make as big a splash as possible. <em>That was all that mattered</em>. I just became a kid running though puddles (albeit in a car).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“but Jesus said, ‘Let the little children come to me and do not hinder them, for to such belongs the kingdom of heaven.’” — Matthew 19:14</p>
</blockquote>

<p>After catching myself in a kid-like state of bliss, I realized that rather than feeling sheepish, I should instead be <em>grateful</em>. It’s no secret that Jesus loved children during His time on earth. I can’t tell you how many times He references children in an esteeming manner. How could I feel ashamed about imitating something Jesus so often advocated? It’s since sunk in that I’m fortunate to be able to be so content and enamored in something so…<em>simple</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“At that time the disciples came to Jesus, saying, ‘Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?’ And calling to him a child, he put him in the midst of them and said, ‘Truly, I say to you, unless you turn and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. Whoever humbles himself like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.’” — Matthew 18:1–4</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What is it about kids that caused Jesus to say this? I think it merely is the <em>simplicity</em>. Since childhood wasn’t all that long ago for me, I recall that life was <em>nowhere</em> near as complicated as I see it today. Everything was pretty much good or bad, yes or no with no in-between. If I was told to go wash my hands, I washed my hands, end of story. I didn’t evaluate the validity of the command, nor the one giving the command. I think childlike is the best way to describe Jesus’ obedience to God. Jesus was told to walk perfectly in step with the plan God laid out leading to crucifixion and that is precisely what He did. I have to imagine this is also how Adam and Eve conducted themselves before eating the apple.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“At that time Jesus declared, ‘I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and understanding and revealed them to little children; yes, Father, for such was your gracious will.’” — Matthew 11:25–26</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think wisdom was actually a result of Adam and Eve’s fall from grace. Allow me to explain. If we have the Spirit revealing the truths of God to us, then I’m not sure what more we could want in terms of knowledge. This knowledge (using the terms interchangeably right now) causes us to question God’s will and doubt both His perfection and love. It is because we are too smart for our own good. And I think it is precisely this overabundance of knowledge that prevents us from enjoying life and its Giver.</p>

<p>Jesus obviously noted that only <em>children</em> would enter heaven (even that it <em>belonged</em> to them) for a distinct reason. He even called children the <em>greatest</em> in the kingdom of heaven. Finally, He noted that God revealed to children what He <em>hid</em> from the wise. If we are to ignore these statements, I’m sorry but we must be brain dead. I know I try so hard to do what I think is “good”, but what I think God really wants is for me to stop taking myself too seriously by trying so hard and allow Him be my <em>Father</em>. This is <em>His</em> story, I’m merely a blessed supporting actor. Rather than having to be so mature and all, let’s just be kids in awe of a Father who gives us more than sufficient reason to be so on a daily basis.</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p>I have been told many times throughout my life that I am a calm person. I have to admit, I feel I do well under pressure and even enjoy times of mild chaos. This is just the way God has made me, but I am highly grateful for it.</p>

<p>However, no matter how comfortable I feel in the physical conditions of chaos and disorder, the moment my soul feels these conditions all bets are off. If there is unrest, if there is calamity within my heart, life all of a sudden feels like I have just slammed on the brakes over a sheet of ice traveling at eighty miles per hour. Everything feels out of control and my usual calm melts away into a form of panic and helplessness.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Not that I am speaking of being in need, for I have learned in whatever situation I am to be content. I know how to be brought low, and I know how to abound. In any and every circumstance, I have learned the secret of facing plenty and hunger, abundance and need. I can do all things through him who strengthens me.” — Philippians 4:11–13</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These words of Paul to the church at Philippi speak to my heart. They remind me, first of all, that my times of unrest and doubt as well as times of joy and happiness are all <em>seasons</em> in this life. It’s not that God doesn’t care about my happiness, but I certainly know it is a secondary concern of His, subjugated to the health of my soul. God allows me to go through all these seasons in due time as He knows each has its purpose in bringing my heart closer to Him.</p>

<p>Yes, oftentimes I do experience doubt, overwhelming doubt in fact. Paul issues this loving reminder to gird my soul against doubt’s cold winter nor’easter. I have a Savior who <em>can</em> and <em>desires</em> to strengthen me against these storms. All I have to do is ask and He is gracious to deliver me. <em>This</em> I feel is the problem, friends.</p>

<p>While cognitively I understand Jesus is the Good and Loving Shepherd, I find it hard to believe this fully in my depths. There is a faction within me that rebels against His assurance and causes strife within my being. I can explain it no better than to say that I am very much at war within myself with the deep fighting with my brain. Frankly, I like to avoid war metaphor, but I am very much at war and there is no denying this fact.</p>

<p>I look back along the path that my life has taken and this dissension is ever-present. Yet, it merely serves as a <em>testament</em> to the immeasurable grace of God through Jesus Christ (Philippians 4:19). The road may be narrow, but God never promised it to be straight. Speaking from experience, the road has been anything <em>but</em> straight and that is what led to the name of this blog. Though the path may be winding and the view of the forthcoming shielded, my foothold has never been loosed as I now realize that my God has established my every footstep.</p>

<p>All along the way, God through various instruments and seasons has provided abundantly for my soul. Most often, I feel it takes the form of deep friendships, but I have seen Him use many other methods in my short time on earth. Never have I been truly left alone. Only in those times have I needed to wipe the tears from my straining eyes so that I could remove the obstruction to see my caring and gracious Lord patiently waiting to whisk me into His capable arms and carry me to my deliverance.</p>

<p>I must also note at this point as I remind myself, we take on trials in life not to get to the other side, but instead to look back throughout and marvel at where God has <em>already</em> brought us. I strongly believe He does this for me because He knows that my heart is weak and in many circumstances I could not stand to wait until the trial had passed to see a glimmer of its greater purpose. I’m not saying I know the reason of this for sure, but this certainly makes most sense for <em>my</em> soul.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“‘I have said these things to you, that in me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation. But take heart; I have overcome the world.’” — John 16:33</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Chaos, disorder and trials all are <em>abundant</em> in this world and they are all supposed to be. Rather than overwhelm, they are meant only to point us to the whelming <em>love</em> and <em>grace</em> of our Lord and Savior. They are supposed to better reveal to us the Light and draw us toward it. Strife is not a curse, but rather a <em>gift</em>. Anything that draws us closer to a God who loves us infinitely, though it may bring pain, can hardly be considered evil. Though the pain may last through the night of our souls, with the morning comes grace anew. We are not alone, as we are never alone, though we may feel we are. God is never far and His angels are hardly more than a phone call away. Rejoice in the doubt and the flood trusting that Christ’s love will never forsake us, nor will He ever let real harm come to us. That fear died the day it was hung on a cross. Now, only love exists. Love has won, forever.</p>

          <h2><a href="/jesus-last-name/">jesus, last name?</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>I’ve spent the past couple days mulling about what I was going to focus on in this post and I think I’ve finally come to the conclusion that I want to continue my series of words that have lost their meaning with Jesus. Yes, I think we’ve lost Jesus, who He was historically and who He is to be to us today, from a hyper-saturation. I’d say that many of us are familiar with some of the stories of Jesus such as Him healing the blind man with mud, feeding the thousands (four or five depending on the occurrence you remember) and probably Him walking on the water. However, because of holidays such as Christmas and Easter as well as the fact that, like it or not, America is a Christian nation and allegory is inescapable at times.</p>

<p>First of all, Jesus <em>was</em> a man, a living, breathing human composed of flesh and blood born in a stable in Bethlehem, Israel. He grew up in Nazareth the son of a carpenter until the age of twelve when He walked into the temple courtyard and started teaching the <em>priests</em> truths about the Torah. He was atypically accepted to spend the next eighteen years studying to become a priest. At age thirty, He began taking His knowledge of God’s word into public places like markets, streets, etc. and spent the next three years amassing His twelve disciples and a multitude of followers, performing miracles along the way. He claimed He was the Son of God and some people believed Him, but this challenge to the religious elite was not to be tolerated and so Jesus was arrested and sent before the local Roman governor to be silenced. Jesus was indeed condemned to die as an enemy of the state, thus He was nailed to a cross. He arose from the dead on the third day and spent the next forty days on earth being seen in various places by varying numbers of people.</p>

<p>That’s the quick and dirty version of the historical Jesus, however the deity of Jesus takes a little longer to explain. First and foremost, <strong>Jesus is the Son of God</strong>. This means that God the Father sacrificed the thing that meant most to Him in this entire universe when Jesus died on the cross. I can’t speak from experience, but sacrificing oneself is honorable, however sacrificing one’s own flesh and blood must be nigh impossible.</p>

<p><strong>Jesus was fully God and He was fully man</strong>. For this to be possible, the Immaculate Conception is almost a foregone conclusion. Jesus was wholly God in <em>spirit</em> and <em>thought</em>. Despite this, He was human in body. In other words, He faced the limitations of hunger, thirst, tiredness and mental capacity. He suffered in the desert and asked God to not have to be crucified (Luke 4:1–13, Matthew 26:39). He was very much a man, but still even in these instances, very much God. Jesus essentially was God scaled down so as to fit into the case that is the human body.</p>

<p><strong>Jesus lived a perfect life</strong>. No, He did not come to do away with the old Jewish laws, but instead to fulfill them <em>all</em> (Matthew 5:17). To do away with the laws, Jesus would have had to break one or at least given due purpose to prove the laws invalid, but He did neither of these. Instead, He presented in plain sight a flawless life as well as the attributes of God. No one else could do this, no one has and no one will ever do this again. To be the perfect sacrifice, He first had to live a life that did not transgress against God.</p>

<p><strong>Jesus is the only way to God in this life and the next</strong>. Whether we realize it or not, the moment you break one of God’s laws you become a dead man walking (Romans 6:23). Breaking God’s laws means that we can no longer have a relationship with Him because He is perfect and therefore cannot associate with that which is impure. The only way to amend this is sacrificing one’s life. However, if you sacrifice your life to repair your relationship with God, you died a sinner and therefore cannot save your own soul and because of this have only the option to go to hell. You see, this is precisely why Jesus had to be the sacrificial lamb. Because He was perfect, He could take on the sins of others, the entire world to be exact, and so we have the ability to repair our broken relationship with God. There is absolutely no other way this redemption could have taken place.</p>

<p><strong>Jesus is our intermediary to God</strong>. Stick with me on this one. So, once we’ve broken our relationship with God, we’re never pure ourselves again. But, when we accept Jesus as our Savior, our reconciliation with God, Jesus becomes our advocate to God because we ourselves are still not <em>pure</em> and continue to sin even after we are reconciled. We need someone who can be in the presence of God and, in turn, God grants the requests of Jesus on our behalf as they are the desires of a perfect Son.</p>

<p>God was finally able to permanently establish His love and grace through the life, death and resurrection of His blameless Son. It is this grace that sets apart Christianity from every other religion and benevolent philosophy. Therefore, it is the life of Jesus and our sharing in His death and immeasurably more in His resurrection that is to set us apart in this life (Romans 6:5). It is not our efforts or our lives at all that make us different, rather it is Christ living in us that will turn heads in this fallen world (Galatians 2:20). That being said, are we cheapening the price paid by Christ or making Him a eunuch for the sake of being accepted? <em>Or</em> are we truly living as Christ in this world?</p>

          <h2><a href="/work-of-heart/">work of heart</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>Yesterday was my first day back to work and, honestly, I was a little anxious to see how it would go. I got up in the morning knowing I would definitely need to spend some alone time with God to find the peace that I’m realizing only comes from Him. As I read through Philippians 2, I began to tear up in the quiet of the dawning morning hours. The most poignant moment was that as I finished rereading the chapter for the second time, the first few rays of sunshine rushed through the high open windows behind me. I knew God was about to seriously answer some prayer.</p>

<p>I’ve written and spoken with a few people about this before, but I was reminded that my job is not merely a 9–5 pastime. While my day job does not <em>ultimately</em> define me, it is a major part of who I am on a day-to-day basis. So it follows that I should treat it with this degree of importance. It is far more than a means, a paycheck; my job will become a significant portion of how I spend my life for the foreseeable future. Therefore, how I view it and my time there is <em>gravely</em> important.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others. Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus, who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, but made himself nothing, taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men. And being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross.” — Philippians 2:4–8</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As God has pointed out to me countless times before, <strong>work is not about me</strong>. My time at work is about working for the benefit of those <em>around</em> me. It could be working a few extra hours during the week to get that report to your stressed manager or boss. Maybe it’s an encouraging comment to a coworker or subordinate. It could even be smiling at someone you don’t directly work with as you pass them in the hallway. If there is anything the past year has taught me, it is that these efforts <em>rarely</em> go unnoticed. And, let’s face it, most of these don’t take much time or effort.</p>

<p>One of America’s secondary mottoes must be, “Fake it ’til you make it.” This is precisely where our efforts are most likely to fall flat. If not immediately, soon your forced smiles and fake acts of kindness will be realized for what they truly are and you will merely find yourself just as empty as before, if not more so. Kindness of this sort is merely a <strong>cult</strong>, portraying the mechanics of worship but severely lacking the <em>heart</em> and <em>intent</em> of worship. I feel this is worse than not doing anything as people begin to distrust you, hindering the future of your working relationships.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Do all things without grumbling or questioning, that you may be blameless and innocent, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and twisted generation, among whom you shine as lights in the world, holding fast to the word of life,” — Philippians 2:14–16a</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This, also, is a matter of the heart <em>behind</em> our actions. I think that’s what Paul’s trying to get at here once again. We need to be out there at work and in the world wearing our hearts on our sleeves, hearts that are desiring to rejoice in the love and grace showered upon us daily. We need to shine brightly that love and grace in the world (cubicle, meeting room, office, etc.) around us through our <em>actions</em> and <em>words</em>. I use this order, because without action, words are hypocrisy, yet sometimes words are truly necessary to supplement action. Wherever you spend the workday, that is your mission field. That is where you are called to be a light in the world.</p>

<p>Seeing the rays of light pass through the clouds driving to work reminded me that I am a light in this world, but that light is not for my solitary benefit. A light is only good when it illuminates the darkness around it, otherwise it is darkness itself. Herein lies the question today. Will we continue to work wearing the blinders of self-absorption or will our work lives resemble the missions efforts that we are so keen on being sent and funding? Isn’t your financial support already being provided for this missions trip?</p>

          <h2><a href="/where-the-heart-is/">where the heart is</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>Four years ago, I was at a concert seeing a band that is still one of my favorites today. Switchfoot’s frontman Jon Foreman announced onstage that the track written for the first Chronicles of Narnia movie was nothing but a lie. Little did I know in that instant that it was to be a watershed moment in my life. It was far more than a notable memory in a great concert.</p>

<p>The name of the song was “Home” and if you haven’t heard it yet, it’s phenomenal. Jon (since I’m claiming him as my friend now) was saying that the idea of home was not what the song was proclaiming. That was interesting as I was just beginning to feel at home in Charlottesville and I did not understand what he meant other than the allusion to Jesus’ quote about not having a place to lay his head.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“And Jesus said to him, ‘Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.’” — Matthew 8:20</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Friends, I have graduated from college, moved outside of Philadelphia, taken numerous road trips and a few flights in the past year. My life has been anything but sedentary. It is only because of all this that I <em>now</em> begin to understand the true meaning of this statement. As usual, Jesus meant far more than what appears on the surface.</p>

<p>The saying goes, “Home is where the heart is,” but <em>that</em> can’t even be taken at face value. The fact is, our heart is not at all where we imagine it to be. The heart that is spoken of here is in fact our soul. Yes, my heart is in my chest, but my eternal heart, or soul, is not. In fact, my soul is in the higher spiritual realm. Therefore, I cannot expect it to be constantly bogged down with my usual day-to-day transient concerns.</p>

<p>That being said, the question of where our heart truly is remains. I’ve said it’s in a higher place, the spiritual realm. With that in mind, I don’t understand why I try to treat my heart as if it were a physical entity. It is in a sense, but it’s most certainly not one. My heart is <em>eternal</em> and it’s about time I treated it in this way.</p>

<p>I can’t treat my heart as I do my physical one, so I am now left at an impasse. I can either treat it as intendedly eternal or merely as a form of flesh. As I alluded earlier, I cannot treat it as flesh, but this is a problem as I also previously stated. I cannot treat it as flesh and bone, despite the fact that I know it to be very real.</p>

<p>My heart is just as real as the very experiences in my everyday life. With my heart being this real, I cannot believe that home (by any definition) is where this heart resides. Here is the crux of this post.</p>

<p>Home is <em>not</em> on this earth. As much as I enjoy this existence, it is not where my heart or home lies. No, my heart is only found in <em>heaven</em>. Therefore, that is precisely where home is. Do you see? Home truly is where the heart is, but not the one that resides in your chest.</p>

<p>At the risk of overstating my point, home is in heaven where our (for the God-fearing Christians of us) hearts reside. They are far above the trifiling concerns of this temporary existence. This fact is critical to understand as it makes more than a world of difference. Friends, we have been given a heart of love and tenderness replacing the one of stone we once possessed. What we do with this instrument is up to us, but the call is unmistakable. We are called to live life at the level of our hearts, above this earth, so with what will we be consumed today? Will it be the short-lived occupations of the present or the concerns of the Kingdom? That question is to be answered daily.</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p>So, acutally, I’m in the Dominican Republic currently and even still, God has found me here. To think that for even a few days I might escape Him is a joke. Even on vacation God can still answer major questions like the purpose of this life. For me, the question is about the purpose of this life.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain. If I am to live in the flesh, that means fruitful labor for me. Yet which I shall choose I cannot tell. I am hard pressed between the two. My desire is to depart and be with Christ, for that is far better. But to remain in the flesh is more necessary on your account. Convinced of this, I know that I will remain and continue with you all, for your progress and joy in the faith, so that in me you may have ample cause to glory in Christ Jesus, because of my coming to you again.”- Philippians 1:21–26</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wish I were John Piper but, since I’m obiviously not, I will have to suffice for paraphrasing his synopsis of this passage in <em>Don’t Waste Your Life</em>. Yes, I’ve been struggling with this question majorly the past several days. It wasn’t until God brought this passage before my eyes that I began to understand His true answer. I hope it’s half as edifying for you as it has been for me.</p>

<p>I noticed first here that Paul (the author) values Christ above all. In other words, there is <em>nothing</em> in this life that means more to him than <em>God</em>. This goes along with last week’s <a href="http://104.193.143.57/~waywar13/ce/2011/08/16/faith-less-dependent/">post</a>. God has to be first and foremost. There are no if’s and’s but’s or or’s about it.</p>

<p>Also, just as importantly, I noticed that life is not about the individual, instead it is about <em>others</em>. Paul notes that his life on earth should be fruitful labor and for the benefit of the <em>progress in faith</em> and <em>joy</em> of those around him. He doesn’t mention any other reason for staying on this planet than that, yet he finds these more important. This should say something for us. In fact, it should speak volumes despite the fact that it seems to ring silent in today’s culture.</p>

<p>I asked this last week, but one of the greatest questions in life is what we value most. If the answer to that question isn’t Christ, our Lord and Savior, then we desperately need to reevaluate our system of morals.</p>

<p>Yes, He is good and His gifts are extravagant, but they are far less than the Giver, Himself. Friends, this is the <em>crux</em> of life. If we get this, there is no falsehood that can stand in our way. Christ said it himself, the most important thing in life is valuing God above all other things (Matthew 22:37–38). I don’t mean to beat a dead horse, but the importance we place on God is <em>that</em> important.</p>

<p>What’s also important is our sense of pride and self-centeredness. I don’t know about you, but I feel I live <em>vastly</em> more for myself than I do others. It’s not what I try to do, however it’s merely a result of my fallen and imperfect nature. This is the <em>exact opposite</em> of the way we are supposed to live. It’s not about me and it’s not about you any more than me! We need to get over ourselves and think about those around us for a change. If we keep this in its right standing, this world will be a better place (Matthew 22:39). However, this change has to begin with us.</p>

<p>I wish I could make this more evident, but I am trying to the best of my ability here, friends. The ultimate we can do in this life is to <em>love our God</em>, the one true Love with all our hearts, our minds and our strengths and <em>then</em> love those around us with all the love that He imparts within us. If He is the Originator of love, then the love we have for others must be <em>pure</em> and <em>abundant</em>. In that case, should the love we share with others not also be enough to quench our own seemingly insatiable needs as well as theirs? Dear friends, here we are today at a crossroads. Do we try to sate our needs for love alone or do we take the gamble that our love for God may satisfy <em>both</em> us and all those around us? Do we dare be so <em>bold</em>? If you won’t, I certainly will.</p>

          <h2><a href="/faith-less-dependent/">faith less dependent</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>Given the rainy nature of this past weekend, I begin to wonder if my attitude towards God isn’t dependent upon the weather. We’ve had torrential rain at some point in each of the past few days and, admittedly, I’ve noticed it’s been progressively harder to rejoice in God and be thankful for all that He’s given me. It’s sad and rather disheartening at the same time. I want to give thanks to God who I know to be good and loving, but I simply can’t muster the feeling within my heart to accomplish that feat. Also, the fact that I’m moving today may or may not have some effect on the level of stress in my life, but varying with the weather sounds better and also provides a Relient K reference on which I couldn’t pass.</p>

<p>I look back once more at my friend (we would definitely be friends if we lived at the same time), Habakkuk. <a href="http://104.193.143.57/~waywar13/ce/2011/08/09/out-of-control/">Last week</a>, we left him with a world that seemed out of control and an answer from God to sit tight. The third and final chapter of this Old Testament minor prophet book shows Habakkuk has done a little more than just sit idly. In the first fifteen verses we see him recounting tales of what he has heard God has done to save His people in the past. It’s an awesome and terrifying recanting, one that visibly haunts Habakkuk as he is thinking about it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I will take joy in the God of my salvation. GOD, the Lord, is my strength; he makes my feet like the deer’s; he makes me tread on my high places.” — Habakkuk 3:18b-19</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Habakkuk then rejoices in God</strong>. He simply says, “God, I will praise You because of who I know You to be. That is reason enough to praise You.” We finally see the prophet complete the transformation, putting his full faith and joy in God. This is the first of two major reasons we are given the example of this prophet. The metamorphosis from complaint and frustration to a man firmly planted in the water of Life, the Word. However, what has caused this seemingly drastic change?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Though the fig tree should not blossom, nor fruit be on the vines, the produce of the olive fail and the fields yield no food, the flock be cut off from the fold and there be no herd in the stalls, yet I will rejoice in the LORD” — Habakkuk 3:17–18a</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Habakkuk is <em>not</em> rejoicing because of what God has just given him</strong>. The present circumstances and surroundings no longer matter to the prophet. Instead, his faith is <em>steadfast</em> and <em>unflinching</em>. Habakkuk does not rejoice here in what God’s done for him, rather he is rejoicing in the greatness and glory of who God is <em>Himself</em>. There are no conditions to the being and character of God as He does not change; He hasn’t and <em>never will</em> (Exodus 3:14). There is a vast difference that the prophet subtly, but profoundly points out here. A faith in the gifts of God changes with our perception of what He’s given us, but a <em>faith in the truths of God Himself is unshakable</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Yet I will quietly wait for the day of trouble to come upon people who invade us.” — Habakkuk 3:16b</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This statement is not possible without a faith firmly rooted in <em>truth</em>. This is where my faith falls short and fails me on a day like today. Faith in anything less than the perfect being of God and His steadfast love is merely a house of cards, ready to fall at the slightest opposing breeze. So, in what will we place our faith, friends? Shall we continue to put it in our ever-changing and unreliable perceptions of the gifts we’ve been given or the God who’s never changed since time began and is the source of all those gifts? The choice is ours, so let’s choose wisely and live a faith less dependent.</p>

          <h2><a href="/born-again-6618fe6206f/">born again</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>I was talking with a friend the other day about living the “born again” life, but mostly about what it meant to be born again in Christ and the level of commitment it requires. She then mentioned something that rang out to me. She started talking about the path of life being a winding one with unforeseen twists and obstacles. “In essence, the path is wayward,” I quietly thought to myself. Then, I was listening to Mumford and Sons this morning as they’re a band I love and I started with the first song on the album <em>Sigh No More</em>. They got to the refrain and I burst into tears. Being born again made sense in a way it has never before.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Love, it will not betray you, dismay or enslave you; it will set you free. Be more like the man you were made to be. There is a design, an alignment, a cry of my heart to see the beauty of love as it was made to be.” — “Sigh No More” by Mumford and Sons</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the love of the heart that has been born again. It is one full of love that is pure and <em>only</em> from God. It is a love that roots us wholly <em>in</em> God. This is the love that replaces a heart and a life of pride and selfishness. This is the way God always intended us to be. What is scary is that it requires your whole life, but if you listen, there is nothing more our hearts want. There is that still voice deep within crying for freedom from the baser affections of this world so it may love and be loved uninhibited, just the way in which it was designed. It was made to love a God who would in kind allow it to fully love <em>others</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“And a scribe came up and said to him, ‘Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go.’ And Jesus said to him, ‘Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.’” — Matthew 8:19–20</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The mention of the path being winding reminded me why I named this blog and nicknamed myself <em>The Wayward Journeyer</em>, because I am simply a sojourner in this life and the path is already meandering and my imperfections lead me often in an even more wayward route. Well, on this path, I have come to the place that dictates I move back to Virginia; I am to move back home. I found a job, but it is not in the state, let alone the locale, that I had expected. And so, this Wayward Journeyer continues down the road, one step at a time. However, I take solace in Jesus’ words above. I do not have a home here, therefore location is trivial compared to my calling.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I have been crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me. And the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me. I do not nullify the grace of God, for if righteousness were through the law, then Christ died for no purpose.” — Galatians 2:20–21</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To say that I do not have fears and reservations would be an immense lie, one which I cannot even fathom peddling upon you, my faithful readers. While I will have my family nearby, I still have to pick up and start life anew. Frankly, my heart aches not to have to do so, but new starts are merely a reality of this world. The thought of having to get familiar with a new residence, find a church and establish a completely new social routine are indeed imposing. God is once again calling me to become uncomfortable and everything within this heart cries out for comfort and stability. However, this is the life of the born again: to follow in the direction that God has set forth, trusting that He is sovereign and good. I must now put one foot in front of the other and allow God to be my stability. I must acknowledge God to be God as He says He is in the Word.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain. If I am to live in the flesh, that means fruitful labor for me. Yet which I shall choose I cannot tell. I am hard pressed between the two. My desire is to depart and be with Christ, for that is far better. But to remain in the flesh is more necessary on your account. Convinced of this, I know that I will remain and continue with you all, for your progress and joy in the faith, so that in me you may have ample cause to glory in Christ Jesus, because of my coming to you again.” — Philippians 1:21–26</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The born again are not of flesh and blood, but immortal. Therefore, the born again are not concerned with the preoccupations of this world such as comfort and familiarity. What is most important in this new life, the born again life, is submitting itself to God so that the Church, the Christ followers around, may also benefit from God working in and through it. It’s a life that lives for God’s purposes, not its own, which often involve the spiritual well-being of others. Therefore, I will go, but I will leave nothing behind because those that are meant to continue down the road with me God will allow to do so and those that don’t will also continue to be taken care of by God. So, friends, let’s live <strong>born again</strong> <em>together</em>.</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p>Friends, I don’t know about you, but it’s gotten to the point that I just don’t want to turn on the news anymore. In the last week, we’ve had the US’s credit score lowered, at least a score of soldiers dead in Afghanistan, the world economy sputtering at best, rioting in the UK and countless other catastrophes. Honestly, it’s too much for me to take in right now. I can’t help but revisit my <a href="http://104.193.143.57/~waywar13/ce/2011/07/22/god-who-are-you/">post</a> from a few weeks back. <strong>Just about everything seems like it’s spinning hopelessly out of control</strong>.</p>

<p>Rewind 2,500 years ago and a prophet, Habakkuk, was saying the same sorts of things. <a href="http://104.193.143.57/~waywar13/ce/2011/08/02/expect-answers/">Last Tuesday</a> I wrote about his first question or complaint to God and this week I’m looking at his second along with God’s answer. His world, like mine, seemed on a collision course hopelessly destined for disaster. Things were bleak and there was no respite or salvation in sight. It seems that in circumstances much like this, I find a kindred spirit, albeit one much more sanctified than myself.</p>

<p>I see so much going on even in the local scene, let alone the national and international scenes and I wonder how God can sit back and just let all this happen. Just <em>look</em> at all the hatred. <em>Feel</em> the pain that is so preeminent. <em>Taste</em> the bitterness that is palpable in the business and financial worlds. <em>Smell</em> the fear wrought with desperation and faithlessness. <em>Hear</em> the cries for an end to this present chaos. I experience evil with all my senses and yet God allows it to continue. I see the faithful flounder while the greedy and self-absorbed flourish and still God seems to be inactive, <em>silent</em>. How can You use these prideful people to the benefit of Your people, let alone Your own glory? God, here I will wait anxiously for Your answer to my complaint.</p>

<p>God, I feel, is answering my heart’s questions here much the same way He answered Habakkuk’s. God is not silent, nor is He inactive.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“For still the vision awaits its appointed time; it hastens to the end — it will not lie. If it seems slow, wait for it; it will surely come; it will not delay.” — Habakkuk 2:3</p>

<p>Deep in my heart, I know that God will prevail and He will work everything out. I need to remember that He has set forth His will before time began and there has been nothing in the history of the <em>universe</em> that has caused a deviation from that will. There is nothing that <em>can</em>, because <strong>God is in control</strong>. Were there a deviation, then this would render God <em>out</em> of control, contradicting both His sovereignty and power. I strongly doubt these attributes to be in question, so His will must not have deviated before and will not now. Therefore, there must be <em>order</em> to all this. If there is order, then there must be a <em>timing</em> that I do not understand here. Also, there is the supreme ability that God has shown time after time in the Bible that He can use literally anything to accomplish His purposes (just look at the crucifixion of Jesus) and create good from intentions borne of pure evil.</p>

<p><strong>But where does all this leave me</strong>? I mean, what do I do with all this and how do I proceed? This is all answered in two verses.</p>

<p>First, I am called to live by <em>faith</em> (Habakkuk 2:4). This is even more important in times like these where seemingly all around wants to rip me violently from my God, my Rock. However, this faith is not idle, but active in living out love and being naked before God in prayer with my praises as well as my doubts and questions.</p>

<p>Also, I am called to be <em>silent</em> (Habakkuk 2:20). I need to give God a chance to respond to my turbulent and wandering heart. This is a relationship, not just a wall. God wants to interact, but He can only do so when I <em>allow</em> Him (like in every other relationship I have) to talk and I quiet my heart with the knowledge that God is <em>sovereign</em> and <em>above all</em>. So, yeah, <strong>I need to just shut up</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“‘Cause standing still isn’t easy when the world’s moving backwards” — “Moving Backwards” by Ben Rector</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think those lyrics sum up these times rather well. I feel the world violently spinning out of control around me with chaos everywhere, but so did Habakkuk. <strong>It wasn’t then and it isn’t now</strong>. However, we must <em>fight</em> for our faith. It is easy to look around and feel overwhelmed with the evil, but <strong>God is present</strong>. He is at work, but that work takes place in <em>His</em> time. Though things look bleak, we have the Light in which we can be steadfastly secured. Let us be <em>diligent</em> in seeking light through this present darkness, because there is a world around that is desperately in need of a little light right now. So ask yourself, “<strong>How can I be that light today</strong>?”</p>

          <h2><a href="/un-christian/">un-christian</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>I was reading through the transcript of a live chat on the <a href="http://live.washingtonpost.com/lisa-miller-on-faith-0728.html">Washington Post</a> and I found myself getting frustrated with what seemed like the lack of answers being provided. Even the answers that were seemed rather weak and it got me thinking that maybe we as a nation are very confused about faith and religion. So, this week, I’m focusing on the word <em>Christian</em>. Sadly, it’s another word that has lost its meaning from over-saturation. Like over-kneaded dough, we have stretched its meaning again and again until the connection between word and meaning have broken completely. So, I ask, what does it mean to be Christian?</p>

<p>Literally, the word means “a follower of the teachings of Jesus Christ.” However, I would argue that today it means nothing more than someone who’s been to a church more than once and recognizes the name Jesus. I mean, just look around at all of us “<em>Christians</em>” burning abortion clinics and shooting the doctors, protesting military funerals and regularly committing every sin imaginable from Monday to Saturday. Sunday, however, typically being reserved for “atonement” by attending a church service…or just sleeping off the hangover.</p>

<p>For those of you becoming indignant right about now, let me say that I am not innocent. I lived this lifestyle most notably in my later high school years running from my parents’ separation. I didn’t want to deal with the implications of that on my life. Much less did I want to go toe-to-toe with a God who I did not know, but with whom I was flat-out pissed. I know this “Christian life” all too well. Now, I’m not saying that I no longer sin, as that’s as far from the truth as can be. However, now that I have become more acquainted with the God I claim to follow by labeling myself Christian, I do sin less than back then. All that to say, I’m not trying to cast stones here.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another: just as I have loved you, you also are to love one another. By this all people will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.” — John 13: 34–35</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First of all, if God is love and Jesus was love in flesh, we as true Christians are to love likewise (1 John 4:8; John 1:14; 1 John 4:11). I really don’t think this needs explanation. However, this love does not include making love outside of marriage. If we are truly following Jesus in loving one another, this means…actually, a lot. However, to keep it simple, this means that we don’t seek to injure others. We’re not looking to gain an advantage over others. More importantly, its <strong>all about others</strong>. First has to come God, then our neighbors (who are <em>everyone</em> else) and <em>finally</em> us.</p>

<p>Next, being a Christian is about the Bible, <em>nothing more and nothing less</em>. If we are adding to Jesus, then we become Pharisees creating for ourselves some false cloak of piety. In reality, we are the emperor who wears no clothes. If we are to take away from the Bible, then we are merely licentious and falling in worship of some lesser earthly pleasure, be it sex, money, drugs…and the list goes on.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly, I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the Law until all is accomplished. Therefore whoever relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever does them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. For I tell you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.” — Matthew 5:17–20</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Finally, as I stated earlier, <strong>it’s not about you</strong>. I can’t stress this enough. Being a Christian is about the One for whom the faith is named. Your body, all that is within it and everything done with it, is to be a living sacrifice for the God of love (Romans 12:1). Every breath, blink, flinch should be all for God whose story, His good, perfect and pleasing will, in which we should be striving to take a protagonist role (Romans 12:2). <em>Yes</em>, you play a role in this story, but you are far from the main character.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Let love be genuine. Abhor what is evil; hold fast to what is good. Love one another with brotherly affection. Outdo one another in showing honor. Do not be slothful in zeal, be fervent in spirit, serve the Lord. Rejoice in hope, be patient in tribulation, be constant in prayer. Contribute to the needs of the saints and seek to show hospitality. Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse them. Rejoice with those who rejoice, weep with those who weep. Live in harmony with one another. Do not be haughty, but associate with the lowly. Never be wise in your own sight. Repay no one evil for evil, but give thought to do what is honorable in the sight of all. If possible, so far as it depends on you, live peaceably with all. Beloved, never avenge yourselves, but leave it to the wrath of God, for it is written, ‘Vengeance is mine, I will repay, says the Lord.’ To the contrary, ‘if your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him something to drink; for by so doing you will heap burning coals on his head.’ Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.” — Romans 12:9–21</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Christian, let us be characterized by this love for others which overflows from our love for our God and Savior. Let us be consistent in watering our souls with His truths so that we may remember in season and out of season how we can best show this love to others (2 Timothy 4:2). Let us also be constant in our prayer in the Spirit that God may hear us and answer (Luke 21:34; Jeremiah 29:12–13). There is simply no other way that we can pretend to follow the will of the One we serve unless we are constantly seeking it. So, do you?</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p>I have a sixth sense, I feel. I can always recognize the moment I’m staring down the cliff of an important conversation off of which I’m about to try <em>not</em> to launch myself. I found myself on one of these cliffs recently and in that moment, the only prayer I could muster in my head was, “God, hi.” All I could say was “hi”?! How about “help” or “give me strength” or something descriptive; some phrase that meant <em>something</em>. No, all I could manage was two letters.</p>

<p>However, what I really meant to say was something to the effect of, “God, I really need Your help right here. Please give me the words and grant us both patience and understanding as we have this conversation,” but God already knew that. I’m pretty sure God heard that, the cry of my heart and I know He answered. In that conversation, though I didn’t trust Him fully with the outcome, He still provided understanding during the conversation so that it went smoothly and without confrontation and the end result was at least as good as I could have hoped for in my head which was racing (for lack of a more accurate phrase).</p>

<p>So, that’s an odd segue, but I see some parallels to Habakkuk’s first plea to God (Habakkuk 1:2–4). First of all, it’s not pretty or polished. Just look at Habakkuk’s list of concerns here. Not once does he use the words “I pray” or “I ask that You just”. Instead, he blurts it <em>all</em> out before God. However, that’s the point, it’s visceral. Habakkuk’s prayer is heartfelt and real. He is pouring out his deepest concerns and desires before God unashamedly. He doesn’t care that people thousands of years later see that he was upset, frustrated, angry, exasperated and utterly emotional. I feel like he’s saying, “Forget y’all, I’m <em>praying</em>!” And that is exactly what he does here.</p>

<p>Now, let’s look at God’s answer. Judging by verses six to eleven, it seems that God’s answering a <em>completely</em> different question. I feel like He’s taken Habakkuk’s concerns and said, “Well, that’s all well and good, but here’s what is important to <em>Me</em>,” and goes off answering what He’d <em>rather</em> answer. Yeah, on first glance, I feel that God is giving the proverbial stiff arm in His response, but being very diplomatic about it. He goes into great detail about the Chaldeans (Babylonians for the rest of us) who will come and conquer Israel. The imagery describing these Godless people is fantastic. Honestly, I wish I could write prose like this, but it doesn’t seem to have a whole lot to do with Habakkuk’s voiced concerns…</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Look among the nations, and see; wonder and be astounded. For I am doing a work in your days that you would not believe if told.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is a very distinct reason why God’s response begins this way. In these two sentences, God answers <em>all</em> of Habakkuk’s concerns. I think volumes could be written about this response. In a nutshell, I hear God saying, “Calm down, son. I hear you just as I’ve heard <em>all</em> your prayers. If you were to take a minute to come down from the ledge, you’d see that I’ve been busy at work answering your prayers and I’m still at work as we speak. You need to give Me a little time, because now is not the right time, but soon enough it will be. Before you die, you will see your prayer come to fruition. Don’t worry, I am just as in control today as I have been since before time and <em>nothing</em> will change that. I love you, but please understand that beyond what I’m about to tell you, you simply wouldn’t understand, so you’ll have to trust Me a little,” but it only took God <em>two</em> sentences to say all that. God speaks so poignantly in this verse and merely expounds in the rest of His response so as to give Habakkuk a foretaste of God’s master plan already in the works. Honestly, it’s <em>brilliant</em> and it’s <em>beautiful</em>.</p>

<p>However, what about when God answers <em>us</em> this way? My response is typically some form of ingratitude stemming from the fact that God didn’t just give me what I asked. That’s not how God works and I need to stop being a baby and limiting Him this way. God doesn’t just give us what we ask of Him. Instead, He gives us a combination of intimacy, responding to our deepest concerns and desires, and majesty, providing little bits of insight into who He is and how He works. God doesn’t operate like an ATM and we can’t expect Him to do so. To expect that would deny God His very <em>essence</em>. So this week let’s bring our naked hearts before God, visceral and real, and let’s expect Him to answer, but answer in a way that only an infinite and boundless God can.</p>

          <h2><a href="/love-to-love/">love to love</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>As last week promised, I’m continuing with my series on words (or phrases, I suppose) that have lost their meaning. Like <a href="http://104.193.143.57/~waywar13/ce/2011/07/19/overwhelmed/">last week</a>, I point to a word whose overuse has been the cause of its lost meaning. The word we love to use to the point of abuse is, in fact, <em>love</em>.</p>

<p>We <em>love</em> everything. We love our families, we love our friends. We love our pets and we love our favorite item of clothing or accessory. We apply the tag love to any and everything today. What does it all mean, though? We use the same word for each item, but does it mean the same thing for all? I think the better question is does it mean <em>anything</em> anymore?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I love lamp.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This phrase seems so ridiculous in Anchorman, however is it all that ridiculous today? I mean, with everything we claim to love, is a lamp out of the question? I’m afraid for our love, friends. I’m afraid that it has been severely bloated to the point of a mere whim of our affections. Our love seems to indicate nothing more than a positive feeling toward something, alive or inanimate.</p>

<p>The Greeks had three words for love and one to express affection. We have one for each. While our language is not as robust in this aspect as the Greek, let us not be constrained by this fact. Let’s take a look at the things we claim to love and measure them against the true definition of love.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“In this the love of God was made manifest among us, that God sent his only Son into the world, so that we might live through him. In this is love, not that we have loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins. Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another.” — 1 John 4:9–11</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, that album I <em>love</em>, I may not exactly be able to say I’m going to lay down my life for it. Yeah, and the same goes for my car, I guess. Oh, and this computer, <em>definitely</em> not. I admit, I belong to the problem I’m highlighting here, friends.</p>

<p>I’ve taken a gift straight from God, the ability to love, and perverted it by directing it at things which are not worthy of such an affection (1 John 4:7). Love is too great a capacity to waste on temporal preoccupations like my wealth, happiness or social standing. Yet, I do this regularly. Love can only overwhelm these diversions until it is ready for something else worthy of it. This is why oftentimes, I become consumed in these things because this love has overtaken the lesser thing at which I have directed it and so instead of redirecting it to something greater, I simply consume myself in this <em>thing</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Love is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast; it is not arrogant or rude. It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; it does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but rejoices with the truth. Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.” — 1 Corinthians 13:4–7</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is not a love that can be satisfied by things, but by <em>God</em> and relationships with <em>people</em>. There is nothing else that is worthy of a love such as this; don’t deceive yourself. Your love is <em>valuable</em>. Our ability to love, even, is a gift, so don’t go throwing it away on meaningless objects. Just like your life, make the most of your love. Also, as you would with your life, don’t hoard your love saving it up for the perfect day, scenario, etc. but use it in a way that is worthy of the Giver.</p>

<p>Our love has been spread so far that we can no longer love the things, particularly God and others, the way we ought. Instead, we are forced to give them the scraps that have not already been allocated, if you will. This isn’t right. It’s not the way our relationship with God was meant to be, nor our relationships with our loved ones. Instead of displaying His love, we serve only to make a mockery of it (1 John 4:12).</p>

<p>Love is a powerful thing. However, we first have to understand the gift that is already in our possession before we can begin to unlock the power it wields. Seek to understand love and then it will produce fruit in your life that will be beyond your imagination, because that is just the nature of God and His gifts.</p>

<p>What kind of world would this be if we saturated it with <em>pure</em> love? That begins, however, with <em>you</em> in the world around you. Therefore, love selectively, but love <em>completely</em>.</p>

  <p>“I think that anyone that says ‘Yes, God is love, but God is also just’ might be misunderstanding both concepts”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This tweet by Michael Gungor (think Gungor band) which was also <a href="http://www.gungormusic.com/blog/?p=134">blogged</a> earlier this month spurned a conversation with myself that has now lasted for over two weeks. While I believe the interplay between justice and love is an important issue, I couldn’t find a way to approach it. Honestly, I had to first reconcile the two concepts in my own head before I could unearth this private discussion in the public arena. Let me tell you, my perceptions of the two have been gravely mistaken for a long time. It wasn’t until reading through Jude (yes, the tiny letter found on the page before Revelation) that the degree of my ignorance was revealed to me.</p>

<p>Jude’s letter is an often overlooked part of the Bible, but most commentators agree contains one of, if not the <em>most</em>, beautiful <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jude%201:24-25&amp;version=ESV">doxologies</a> of the entire Bible. Yet, because of its size and location, it is ignored by causal Bible readers such as myself opting to frequent the oft-quoted letters of Paul and Gospels. However, there is a message here that rings truer today than I believe it did back then.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Beloved, although I was very eager to write to you about our common salvation, I found it necessary to write appealing to you to contend for the faith that was once for all delivered to the saints. For certain people have crept in unnoticed who long ago were designated for this condemnation, ungodly people, who pervert the grace of our God into sensuality and deny our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ.” — Jude 3, 4</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You may disagree, but I believe that with the overabundance of information today, never has the Truth been more susceptible to perversion and watering down. We have instant access to whatever false gospel on which we wish to get our hands. However, I’m not here to lay a beat down on the Church I am called to love. Instead, I wish to do just that, <em>love</em> her.</p>

<p>Without getting into your belief on predestination and its ethics and merits, I want to take a look at the people here who are spoken of as ungodly. The letter goes on to say how this sort of people have been and will continue to be condemned. Yes, this sounds harsh and even hateful, but I say that after further consideration, it’s not at all.</p>

<p><strong>God is <em>love</em></strong>. In being love, He relents and gives those who want nothing to do with Him exactly what they want. He eventually grants them permanent separation from Himself. Ungodly people here refers to people who have rejected God and because He gave us all free will, God eventually gives these people exactly what they have proved they desire most. Yes, they are judged, but their judgment is just <em>and</em> loving. They have both gotten what they deserve as well as what they wanted most.</p>

<p>Yes, I don’t fully understand all that is going on here and I don’t like the thought of people going to hell, but I can’t help believe that there is both love and justice here. As another illustration of this interplay, I look to my parents. They disciplined me a good bit when I was a child. I did lots of things that were wrong and hurtful to myself as well as others. As a means of justice, it was only sensible that I be punished to deter my poor behavior. It was also in love that they granted me justice so that I might take that justice as a cause to act more civilly. It was love that provided the motivation, I believe, for my parents to feed me the otherwise bitter medicine of justice so that I would be slowly cured of the infirmity of a reckless and ignorant spirit. Doesn’t God just do this on the macro-scale?</p>

<p>Rather than “love, but…” we should be saying “love and…” God is love as the Bible makes perfectly clear. I don’t know if we can even separate true justice and love, because without love, justice is merely revenge. In fact, I challenge you to show me justice that is not an example of love. Justice is merely a way that love manifests itself so that we can feel it, see it and experience it; or maybe we’re really experiencing a preview of God Himself.</p>

            <p>I’m not sure exactly where this post came from. Could be from my reading in Augustine’s <em>Confessions</em>. Maybe it’s because I was with a friend who had his bag stolen at the beach. Or maybe, it’s just where I am in life with all its twists and turns. Whatever the impetus, it led me to a very honest conversation with God the other morning. I don’t have a ton of them, because I feel I need to be composed and proper around Him. I know that to be fodder, but habits die hard. Here’s an excerpt from that conversation. These are my unfiltered thoughts. This is how I believe a true relationship with God should be and I feel I have much to glean from my own musings in this time. A relationship with God isn’t pretty, tidy or certain. It’s filled with doubt, questions and everything we have come to associate with earthly relationships. My only prayer is that it stirs up some questions in your heart about your relationship with or understanding of God.</p>

<p>God, I don’t trust your goodness. Though You say You’re good, loving and have my ultimate benefit in mind, I seem to want to believe the exact opposite. This belief obviously conflicts with Your word, what I know to be true. I suppose it’s one of the many lies I believe about You, Father. I don’t want to believe these lies, however; I want truth.</p>

  <p>“I gave You brokenness, You gave me innocence and love,” — Audrey Assad</p>

<p>I read into these lyrics defeat. God, I have <em>nothing</em> to offer You. I have nothing that hasn’t been tainted or that would be suitable to a king, let alone the King of kings. God, what could You want from this bastard son who constantly disobeys and is evil to the core? What possible purpose could be served through keeping me around? I am a mere man and a wicked one at that. God, I do not understand in the least.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast. For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them.” — Ephesians 2:8–10</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What keeps You stooping down to a backwards species, loving, taking care of and using us in a divine master plan? Surely, there is less frustrating.</p>

<p>God, I cannot begin to fathom Your grace. How can it be? What is this grace extended even to a wretch like myself?</p>

<p>What don’t You just give up? We will always be crooked. Move on to something that has a capacity and a will to understand and know You more. You have been dealing with a planet of incapable infants for millennia where You’ve had to provide and do <em>everything</em> for a people who are wholly incompetent. Don’t You grow weary? Don’t You need a vacation? Wouldn’t You like a break from the frustration and the tedium of managing this hell-bound planet?</p>

<p><strong>God, who are You?</strong></p>

<p>You are obviously not a man, nor are You mortal. You must be remarkably <em>patient</em>. I could not bear my own insolence, let alone a planet full of it. You must possess a <em>love</em> unparalleled. Otherwise, how could I have the life I have on an earth that is not a purgatorial wasteland? My entire existence would merely be hell on earth as that is what I am certain I deserve. You must also possess an otherworldly <em>wisdom</em> as I cannot begin to understand what is going on in my own microcosm. There is no hope of me understanding the world or universe as a whole. You must be <em>sovereign</em>, because how else could you be in complete control of an ever-expanding universe? In addition, You must also be more <em>precious</em> than metals and stones. Why else would my heart and millions of other hearts cry out for You and nothing else? If my depths want You above all, then You must possess some great <em>worth</em>. You must be extremely <em>personable</em> and love <em>community</em> if You have conversations with individuals and groups alike throughout the globe all day and every day. Therefore, You must also be <em>tireless</em>, supremely <em>caring</em> to listen as well as the best <em>listener</em> ever.</p>

<p>You seem <em>good</em> and <em>mighty</em> and <em>holy</em>, but what do the sadness, grief and calamity in my life and the world say about who You are? How do death and pain fit into the beautiful picture of You my heart paints? I have listed several aspects here of <em>goodness</em>, <em>beauty</em> and <em>perfection</em>, but these last few seem conflicting. God, in a world pockmarked with conflict and tension, I ask You once more to reveal Yourself. <strong>Who are You</strong>?</p>

            <p>Little did I know that my post on <a href="http://104.193.143.57/~waywar13/ce/2011/07/12/enough/">success</a> would launch me into a series that would have me examining words whose meaning I feel have been whittled away until they no longer carry the meaning they were intended. This feels a little like Sesame Street (my favorite show growing up) when I say this week’s word is <em>overwhelmed</em>.</p>

<p>Sure, you’re thinking I’m a doofus right now for suggesting such a widely used word has lost meaning. However, I think its overuse in today’s over-worked and hyper-busy society has in fact led to what I’m referring. We use it for everything from traffic to weather to stress to people to our pets and every other situation imaginable. Despite the abundance of applications, have you ever used the word in reference to God?</p>

<p>Herein lies my point. We restrict our use of the word to menial and temporal instances, but ignore an <em>infinitely</em> (literally) more important application. Last time I looked into the matter, the Bible asserted several times that God is indeed infinite. That in and of itself should, based on magnitude alone, be overwhelming. There is no limit that exists for God. There is nothing that God cannot do. Time, doesn’t exist. Space, just a human term. Every other dimension, He created so we could understand the universe a little better, but that is pretty much their only purpose. He supersedes all knowledge and understanding because He is the originator of both. He created everything we could possibly come up with, so don’t you think He’d have to be a little smarter than each to be able to think it and speak it into being? Oh yeah, and He <em>spoke</em> life itself into being.</p>

<p>Honestly, I really enjoy using the archaic word <em>whelm</em> as it’s a fun word that no one uses. However, I use this with God. It’s truly sad that God doesn’t overwhelm me. It’s sad that God doesn’t draw an occasional “ooh” or “ahh” when He does the cool stuff in my life to which I’m now accustomed. Come on, even fireworks get those responses! Look at what I said before the fireworks comment, focusing on the word <em>accustomed</em>. That’s a fancy way of saying that I’m complacent in my understanding of God; He fits in my little box and that God is not _over_whelming, but merely whelming. It’s like a my-size God figurine that I have a relationship with here. But where does this get me?</p>

<p>What I’m getting at is I don’t let God wow me. I’ve taken for granted His constant grace to the point where I’m just <em>calloused</em> to it all. I value the <em>gifts</em> over the Giver, but they’ve grown old. The intent was never to value them in this way, but it is where my twisted heart has led me. However, it is comfortable and familiar. I’m not asking God to amaze me with fireworks; it’s actually the opposite. I’m saying that I’ve lost my ability to be overwhelmed by the constant grace of God that is all around me.</p>

<p><strong>Complacency is the enemy</strong> when it comes to being overwhelmed with the greatness and the majesty of God. I’ve reached an understanding that I’m comfortable with and been able to take the mystery out of my god. This god is travel-sized, but he’s <em>useless</em>. This replica of God doesn’t challenge me or provide for any of the essentials (salvation and sustenance, for example) which my soul needs simply because it can’t. Only God can do that. Despite my hard-headed nature, I do recognize this fact.</p>

<p>Maybe I’m missing the mark on the purpose for believing in God in the first place, but this miniaturized caricature I’ve created isn’t cutting it. God only works when I allow Him to be unimaginable and unexplainable. If God really is who He claims to be in the Bible, then I simply should not have the facilities to comprehend all that He is. Now, I should have an idea and always seek to know and understand Him better, but ultimately a little bit of infinity is still pretty much nothing. Let’s let God be overwhelming and let <em>Him</em> make aspects of Himself whelming to us, not the other way around.</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p>For those of you who didn’t know, I’m currently in the throes of a job search. I had a promising trail that looked like was going to end well. I got through the phone interview with my interviewer audibly impressed. I went into the face-to-face interview and was reassured that the same interviewer was rather interested in me, despite my being thrown off by its unorthodoxy. I left feeling pretty good about the call back I would get the following week.</p>

<p>That call came. I’m still unemployed. I had been the runner up for the opening, but there was someone else who was better and more qualified than myself. He would be getting the job because I simply wasn’t good enough. I didn’t make the cut. Like a few soccer tryouts I’d had growing up, there was one spot to fill and I wasn’t the brightest prospect in the field. This is what I heard in that conversation.</p>

<p>What was said, however was vastly different. The guy on the other end told me that I was the runner up, yes, but then reiterated the fact that there would be another opening coming within the next two months and that he wanted to stay in touch over that period of time because the company was very interested in me. He also told me that the person transitioning out of the position, rather than transferring to another department had decided after my interview to put in his two weeks and so they went with the person with more experience given the much abbreviated timeline to learn the ins and outs of the position.</p>

<p>You see what I did there in my head? I heard, “We went with someone else for the position…” and spun that into some shot at my ability and ego. However, he said nothing intrinsically about <em>me</em>. I’ve been out of school for just over a year now, so they made their decision based on a factor that is completely out of my control and not at all characteristic of me or my ability.</p>

<p>If it wasn’t about me, then what was it really about? Was it about my interviewer? The company? How about the weather? You know what, maybe it was about the janitor. Each of these are just as ludicrous as the last. This opportunity, my entire job search and everything encompassed therein is about <em>God</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“This God — his way is perfect; the word of the LORD proves true; he is a shield for all those who take refuge in him.” — Psalm 18:30</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My job search is merely a side narrative in the greater story of what God is doing in my life, which in turn is a small part of the overall story of what He’s doing and been doing since before time began. God has a plan for my employment that is in accord with what He doing in my life and how that interplays with what He’s doing globally. I will have a job when it fits where I need to be in the greater context of things. Right now, I’m not there. I needed this deferment and the disappointment to bring me further toward where He wants me to be. He used this event to shape me a little more into the being He originally intended me to be.</p>

<p>This isn’t just happening in regards to this pursuit, but in all aspects of my life. God is always shaping, bending and molding me like a loving potter does a fine vase. All the while, I may feel like I’m being ruined, made uglier or on the verge of breaking (if pottery could think and feel). However, each gesture is deliberate and every event He uses to shape me has a greater and loving purpose behind it. It’s not torture or malice, but pure love.</p>

<p>I used the example of this job, but I try to make <em>everything</em> in life about me. It’s a common, but terminal condition called <strong>pride</strong>. Once I see through that fog, I can begin to see the beauty in my circumstances. This only comes through prayer for faith that cuts through the fog. The experience no longer seems painful, but joyful and glorious in light of God’s love for me. God loves me enough to painstakingly sanctify me every day, lovingly molding me into the masterpiece I will be when He is done.</p>

<p>So, what about yourself? What is that job search for you? Then, ask yourself if it’s really painful or that’s just your ego pushing back against God’s loving care for your greater good.</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p>So, I’m nearing the end of Jon Acuff’s <em>Quitter</em> and I came across the word “success”. The word in and of itself is unremarkable. It’s what we all strive toward in some fashion or another and when someone makes it into the big time, we all know what it looks like. However, I realized my definition of success is limited that of the macro variety. If someone isn’t internationally recognized, then they could be more successful. They aren’t successful <em>enough</em>.</p>

<p>The words “successful enough” are really my hang up with the idea of success. It doesn’t translate for me. I don’t have a category for that term. That’s probably because it’s intentionally not well defined. Or maybe it’s just been eroded by society over time.</p>

<p>Successful enough is dependent upon the individual. We each have to define with what level of success we are comfortable. This means that most likely we could become more successful, but we turn down that extra success because it is no longer worth the effort necessary to achieve it. For instance, I could try for that 100,000th reader (I wish), but if it means that I have to do so at the cost of giving up my last remaining waking moments to do so, then I would have to say I’d pass. That’s completely theoretical for me, but what does that look like for you?</p>

<p>You can’t define <em>enough</em> if you don’t know even what direction success is in for you. So, first of all, you have to decide in what you were created to be successful and obediently pursuing it <em>actively</em> (ahem). Jon (like I know him) uses the term <em>platform</em> to describe this essentially. Define your platform (your message and its intended recipients) and develop it. You have to know where you stand before you begin to reach beyond. If you have nothing to stand on, then…well, you’re just falling hopelessly through the ether. Sorry, but you <em>definitely</em> need something to help prop you up on this one.</p>

<p>You might have noticed the word <em>risk</em> I used earlier. In determining what success looks like for you, the risk involved in attaining your success also has to be mapped out. You have to sit down and determine how much risk is acceptable to you. Obviously, if you are risk averse, then your risk will be slightly less than someone who is more risk seeking. That being said, just because you are more comfortable with risk means you should accept any and all that is presented to you. At some point, you run into the law of diminishing returns and that risk is worth more than the reward sought.</p>

<p>No, I’m not naive enough to think that success doesn’t come without planning all these things out, but <em>enough</em> success is impossible without it. Sure, maybe you’re experiencing success right <em>now</em>, but your success will never be what you want it to be if you don’t take the time to figure out for yourself what is both attainable and desirable. Unchecked, your success can only become a burden, either underwhelming or overwhelming because the middle of the road doesn’t exist yet. Without planning, your success, current or future, can only disappoint you. Sorry to rain on your parade here.</p>

<p>Following your dreams and passions isn’t all fun and games. Otherwise, we’d never have dreams and aspirations. We’d merely have thoughts that we immediately put into action and we’d all be trillionaires at the very least. That’s not true and will hopefully never be true (what fun would life be then). The effort and the risk both make the pursuit of these things worth everything we give up in the process. If it’s truly your life calling, God will not forsake you, but it’s up to you to make the most of your time and pursue it <em>wisely</em>. Do yourself the favor and make a plan. Without it, you will find yourself no further down the road to your dream, frustrated and with less time to pursue it than what you started. Don’t be afraid of the risk; be <em>aware</em>. There will be surprises and there will be bumps, but you wouldn’t have started down this path were you not expecting some form of unknown. Embrace it and enjoy the ride.</p>

            <p>Apparently, watching Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Pt. 1 and reading Ephesians 6:10–20 in the same day led me to believe there <em>has</em> to be some tie-in buried deep down. Please excuse me as I wasn’t intending to play on the movie’s release in a week.</p>

<p>Qualifications aside, I’ve been thinking recently about my daily walk with Jesus. I have to admit, it’s been a little disappointing. You know the poem where the person is looking back at the footprints in the sand and where they see only one set of footprints, Jesus tells them He was carrying them at that point? Yeah, well I feel a lot like I’m that person looking back and saying, “What the heck, Jesus?!” My walk feels more like a wounded stagger at best. But, what has caused my once normal feeling walk with Him to become so sickly?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Finally, be strong in the Lord and in the strength of his might. Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the schemes of the devil. For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers over this present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places. Therefore take up the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand firm. Stand therefore, having fastened on the belt of truth, and having put on the breastplate of righteousness, and, as shoes for your feet, having put on the readiness given by the gospel of peace. In all circumstances take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming darts of the evil one; and take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God, praying at all times in the Spirit, with all prayer and supplication. To that end keep alert with all perseverance, making supplication for all the saints, and also for me, that words may be given to me in opening my mouth boldly to proclaim the mystery of the gospel, for which I am an ambassador in chains, that I may declare it boldly, as I ought to speak. — Ephesians 6:10–20</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I read this and immediately thought to myself, “This is why my relationship with Jesus is sucking right now. There’s so much you have to do and think about on a daily basis that it’s nearly impossible to maintain a healthy relationship with Him.” Look at that list of the armor I’m supposed to put on each day as a Christian! I need at least an hour before breakfast to put on my helmet, shoes, breastplate, belt, shield, etc.! I’m sorry, but I think I’ll take my lackluster following of Jesus and settle for it. I’m not going through all that.</p>

<p><strong>I’m an idiot</strong>. Yes, because if you look at it, the list is really pretty simple. Paul is putting following Jesus into a metaphor (obviously) and I got caught up in focusing on the armor rather than what each piece represents. “The helmet of salvation? Oh, right. I’ve had that since I accepted Jesus as my eternal Savior.” Then you have the shield of faith. “Well, that’s just believing in God and who He says He is,” no real sweat there (to a degree). What about the breastplate of righteousness? “Um…last time I checked, God was pretty fully in charge of that aspect of my life (when I step back and let Him).” So what about the shoes and the sword?</p>

<p>I lumped these two because I feel they’re integrally related. What knits them perfectly together is prayer. There are really three things that need to be worked on each day. The first being, as I mentioned, prayer, then spending time in the word and finally putting faith in what you’ve read. The sword is the word and praying that back to God and the shoes are the urgency produces from the reading of the word. That’s it. That’s all there is to it.</p>

<p>But, what’s really the purpose here? Enter Harry Potter and Ron Weasley as Harry is trying to sneak away from the Burrow (the Weasleys’ home) in the middle of the night. Harry is trying to save everyone because he is putting them at risk by being there, to which Ron wisely responds, “You may be the chosen one mate, but this is a whole lot bigger than that. It’s always been bigger than that.”</p>

<p>I think this rings true in our lives, especially spiritually. Our personal relationships with our Savior are far more important than just ourselves. Who am I to think I’m all-important here and the tension in the spiritual realms centers around me? It’s <em>infinitely</em> bigger. It always has been bigger than that.</p>

<p>The fact is, our armor is only as good as it is complete. If we are forgetting even <em>one</em> piece, it is penetrable and serves merely as baggage or useless weight. If I don’t pray or don’t intentionally spend time in the Bible, I am missing a piece. Can you say at the end of the day that you have done <em>all</em> to withstand the powers that be, standing firm in Jesus? I want you to sit down and answer this honestly to yourself. If not, what really is there to say at all..?</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p>I’m currently reading through <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Quitter-Jon-Acuff/dp/0982986270">Quitter</a> by <a href="http://www.jonacuff.com/blog/">Jon Acuff</a> and in spending more time in Ephesians, I could not help but notice a distinct connection in Ephesians 6:5–9. And then I began to ask the question of how I view work. Honestly, <strong>I am not satisfied with the answer</strong>.</p>

<p>I view work as eight hours a day, five days a week spent trying to please my boss. Each new day is spent figuring out how I can get by with doing <em>less</em> work than the day before without anyone else noticing. Time spent in any single position is reduced to a downward spiral of increasing <em>laziness</em> and <em>complacency</em>.</p>

<p>Yes, you want your boss/manager to be pleased with your work, but I think work should have a greater purpose. I have spent nearly every working day (up to now, so not very many) merely <em>eking</em> out a workplace subsistence. I do my work well (enough), but I often find my motivation flagging after I’ve been somewhere a while. It never made sense until now. Trying to please a customer or a manager isn’t motivation enough to sustain satisfaction in one’s work. I need something <em>deeper</em>, <em>lasting</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Slaves, obey your earthly masters with fear and trembling, with a sincere heart, as you would Christ, not by the way of eye-service, as people-pleasers, but as servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart, rendering service with a good will as to the Lord and not to man, knowing that whatever good anyone does, this he will receive back from the Lord, whether he is a slave or free. Masters, do the same to them, and stop your threatening, knowing that he who is both their Master and yours is in heaven, and that there is no partiality with him. — Ephesians 6:5–9</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I understand the first word says ‘slaves’, but there is the caveat later on that reads “whether he is a slave or free’ indicating this passage isn’t only for slaves in the strict definition. Paul here is talking to everyone who works and is informing us of <em>how</em> and <em>why</em> we should work. He uses the words “fear and trembling”, however given the context, I believe he’s asserting that as employees we should be <em>reverent</em> toward our superiors. This can’t be fake, however, merely keeping things looking copacetic, but <em>actually</em> being diligent in our work at all times. If we do not do this from the heart, what good do we really do for anyone? Sure, we may please our manager in the short-term, but that’s not ultimately who we’re trying to please. <em>God</em> has to be our motivation and that has to be rooted deep down in our hearts. If it’s not, then we are as fake as the silk flowers we’re putting on our desks. If we’re working merely to please people, it’s but a matter of time before you’ve learned all the corners you can cut and how to do only enough to submit work that is passable. Then, your job loses challenge and inevitably you lose interest and desire.</p>

<p>Our true motivation has the ability to turn a great job into a miserable one and vice versa. If you have to be in the office five days a week for 45 hours or more a week, <strong>why not make the best of it</strong>? Why not keep yourself on your toes and at least <em>like</em> the job and the place where you spend a majority of your week? Otherwise, we set ourselves up for misery at work and I can guarantee that will bleed over into all the other aspects of your life. Trust me on that. Discipline begets discipline, but the alternative is also true. Don’t fall into the trap of scraping out an existence at work. Rather than ask yourself how you can get by today, ask how you can <em>thrive</em> because you have a God who is desiring to rain down a reward for your hard work and diligence. Plus, people will notice and begin to ask about the difference. Don’t waste another day.</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p>As a disclaimer, I am not an expert on prayer. In fact, I would consider myself rather novice when it comes to this facet of my spiritual life. I don’t know if there’s anything I would consider myself to be an expert on, actually, but prayer is especially a weak point for me. Sorry, I had to get that off my chest.</p>

<p>Despite this fact, I think prayer is one of if not the most important aspect of a Christian’s life. Let’s face it, how else do we talk to Jesus? If He’s the One we’re following and He doesn’t have a cell phone or mailing address (that I know of), what other method of communication are we left with? And if I am to follow Him, I feel like communication is key as in every other relationship.</p>

<p>If prayer is as important as I’m making it to be, then isn’t the way we pray also important by association? This is where my concern lies. This is where I think many prayer lives including my own hit a roadblock at some point and it’s a big one.</p>

<p>From as long as I can remember, a prayer was evaluated based on how eloquent and full of emotion it was. Every time the person praying used the phrases “I just pray that…”, “please bless…”, “be with”, “go ahead of…”, “we leave ___ in Your hands” and similar sayings we’re all familiar with, they scored a point. Now, if you started using other names for God, like Father, Lord, Jehovah, etc. then you got bonus points and then if you strung them together to form a super-interjection in your prayer there was a multiplier to those bonus points. Finally, when the person wanted to express feeling, they had to speak in a raspy whisper. The more the people had to strain to hear the words, the more genuine the prayer had to be.</p>

<p>I know this is getting a little ridiculous, but that’s what it all is, isn’t it? When did we decide on all these as rules for prayer? Better yet, what do they all mean? Have you ever stopped to ask yourself, “What did I just pray?” I know half the time I cannot answer when I ask myself.</p>

<p>First of all, God is most definitely a person. He is not a person in being human, but He has all the other characteristics of personhood. In being a person, should we not also communicate with Him like a person? Therefore, “Dear God…” is a completely unnecessary way to begin a prayer. We are not writing a letter, this is far more direct than being God’s pen pal.</p>

<p>God is also far more intelligent than we are, so we can just dispense with the use of flowery and pedantic language in our prayer. We’re praying, not auditioning for Hamlet. In other words, just say what you mean. For instance, what on earth does the verb “bless” actually mean? I understand it’s meaning, but where else in our daily lives do we use the word? Does anyone go to Subway and ask if they can be blessed with a six-inch chicken breast sandwich on whole wheat? No! If you’re asking for blessing, just spell out the end result you’re desiring of God.</p>

<p>Here’s a personal favorite of mine. If we can only communicate with God through prayer, why do we announce that we’re praying? Do we walk up to our friends and say, “Hey, I’m telling you that I say ‘hi’.”? I’m certain you’d be committed if you spoke that way, so what makes it acceptable when talking to God? I just imagine God up there chuckling, “Yes, how else are you going to talk to Me?” Sorry, this just cracks me up.</p>

<p>If God is infinite, then how can He “go ahead”? Time and space are not limitations to Him, therefore He can’t really <em>go</em> anywhere. If He did, then He’s not infinite and I wouldn’t be typing this post. There would be several other negative implications, not the least of which would most likely include multiple simultaneous natural disasters. I mean, God spoke and look what happened; life was created.</p>

<p>Finally, God’s real and natural and everywhere, so He can hear you if you just speak in your normal speaking voice. If you’re feeling particularly emotional with your friends, typically you get a little choked up and it doesn’t sound so pretty but no one cares. The same should be true with God. Raspy whispers express nothing other than maybe Jack Bauer trying to speak in his indoor voice (not taking a shot at my boy, Jack).</p>

<p>While the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5A0-u85aAYg">prayer scene from Talladega Nights</a> seems ludicrous, I don’t think it is all that far off from the ridiculous way I learned to pray over the years. I dare you to just try praying without these prayer cliches and see how many people are looking at you while you do so. Sure, you may not be nominated as your church’s prayer MVP, but I’m pretty sure God doesn’t care about our Christian “trophy cases”. In fact, I think he appreciates the concise, somewhat messy version even more (Matthew 6:5–12).</p>

<p>I know I need to get better at prayer, because I commit each one of these faux pas on a regular basis. The only way to do so, however is practice; therefore, pray! It’ll take time, but make a conscious effort to skip the fluff and just tell God what you mean to tell Him, nothing more. I guarantee it will sound clunky and there will be some uncomfortable silence, but in time it’ll become more natural. You’re undoing a lifetime of learned prayer habits and that is no small task. I can say that I’ve already seen a greater depth in my own prayer life in the short time I’ve been trying this. You may not have the eloquence of Shakespeare, but you will be working toward a depth far greater in your prayer than you may have been able to imagine.</p>

            <p>I think we all know the famous FDR quote from his first inauguration speech, “The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.” I think we all have a pretty good idea what he meant as well. Honestly, I knew deep down that I had correctly interpreted what he meant for years. That was until just a few seconds ago.</p>

<p>The words <em>doubt</em> and <em>unbelief</em> both come up rather often in the Bible. I suppose that means they encompass an important topic to God (if we are to accept the Bible being fully inspired by Him). I know in my own life I doubt a lot. More precisely, I think a lot and even though I am a hopeless optimist, I am also analytical. Therefore, while deep in my heart I want to believe the best in a situation, I have already made a list of the possible negative outcomes and assigned some sort of probability to each. For instance, the moment I take an interest in a girl, I have already enumerated the potential barriers to a relationship forming and then working out to some degree. That was just an example, but I do this with just about <em>everything</em>.</p>

<p>OK, so I’d say doubt is a significantly inhibiting factor in life. It is just this thought that turned on the light bulb in my head revealing what I think FDR was truly getting at with this quote. The greatest obstacle we will face in this life is our doubt, the fear of the unknown that lies ahead, and every risk we take will have to be in spite of that fear. I think what is understated is that fear is around <em>every</em> corner and <em>every</em> decision.</p>

<p>Fear takes many forms, however. It is not always that paralyzing jolt down your spine. It can be that quiet voice telling you to not take that risk because the logistics don’t line up or you’re not ready. It could be that voice telling you not to take such a risk because the stakes are too high. It could be nearly anything.</p>

<p>Look at the passage in Mark 9:14–29 and Matthew 17:14–20 where Jesus casts the demon out of a boy suffering from epilepsy. The father is pleading with Jesus to cure his son. He asks if there is anything Jesus can do and Jesus turns the request back on the father.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“…But if you can do anything, have compassion on us and help us.” And Jesus said to him, “‘If you can’! All things are possible for one who believes.” — Mark 9:22–23</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The father then replies with the oft quoted “I believe; help my unbelief!” and Jesus cures the child. Notice, the man <em>admits</em> his doubt. I think this statement is more than monumental for defining what Jesus is actually saying about believing.</p>

<p><strong>Faith is not the absence of doubt</strong>. Rather, it is merely acknowledging our doubt and prayerfully asking God to erase that doubt with His love. Faith is actively trusting God in spite of everything within telling you He’s not safe, not loving, caring, etc. and all the while praying He will replace those doubts with the steadfast dependence only He can instill.</p>

<p>Finally, I want to look at the account of this story in Matthew where the disciples after the healing ask why they could not exorcise the demon. His answer gives me so much hope in light of my perceived disbelief. I see the sincerity and the sadness in Jesus’ voice when He answers:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Because of your little faith. For truly, I say to you, if you have faith like a grain of mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move, and nothing will be impossible for you.” — Matthew 17:20</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In case you weren’t aware, a mustard seed is about the smallest seed there is (it was the smallest seed with which the audience at the time would have been familiar). What I understand from this statement is that God wants to work through our faith no matter how small it is. <strong>God blesses</strong> <strong><em>all</em></strong> <strong>our feeble attempts to obey and follow Him</strong>. He can work through any amount of disbelief so long as we are willing to give Him a little room. He’s not going to force our obedience, but when our hearts are in the right place (even if only slightly), He shows up in a big way and does mighty things with that tiny faith.</p>

<p>Faith is not the absence of, but action in the <em>presence</em> of fear. Doubt looks to hold us back at every moment, but when we decide to press on and put our faith into practice, <em>nothing</em> is impossible. Yes, we should be striving toward a perfected faith, but Jesus Himself acknowledged that there would be doubt. However, in that acknowledgement, there is the promise that God can accomplish great things even with only a tiny bit of faith on our part. Will you choose to trust Him at His word and water that little seed today?</p>

          <h2><a href="/passive-aggressive-b93eb02095/">passive // aggressive</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>Hi, I’m passive-aggressive. I don’t know if you’re familiar at all with Southern or Middle Eastern culture, but they are both rather similar in several aspects. Most notably in my mind, they are some of the most passive-aggressive cultures that I’ve encountered. Therefore, since I am half of each, I say I was cursed from birth.</p>

<p>For a long time, I took pride in the fact that I could “hide” my emotions and not react to situations or blow up at people. I learned to bottle things up so my anger just “disappeared”. One thing I learned about anger, or any emotion for that matter, is that it never just disappears; it has to go <em>somewhere</em>. I would swing from the playground of anger between the extremes of Job to a violent explosion of pent up anger especially when I was younger.</p>

<p>My poor sister can back all this as she was often the object of such outbursts. Sadly enough, I took it as far as choking her a few times in our childhood (not trying to make her pass out or kill her). You would think that something like that would rouse someone to the realization that something is very wrong. No, that wasn’t until college. Even now, my passive-aggression is something I struggle with horribly.</p>

<p>I’m not going to say that I’d rather be outright aggressive when dealing with problems and conflict, but there has to be a median. There has to be a place where I can go in these times and acknowledge the situation, but in a healthy and productive way. There has to be a way that does not leave me bottling up this residual feeling of iniquity. Judging by interactions throughout my life, I know I’m not the only one with this problem.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“But when anything is exposed by the light, it becomes visible, for anything that becomes visible is light.” — Ephesians 5:13–14</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is a lot that is said in the Bible about anger, but I think this passage is rather interesting. I think this is God giving a practical way of dealing with a flawed method of dealing with emotion. “Let <em>Me</em> deal with it. Let <em>Me</em> take this burden from you, because it requires a heart change and <em>I</em> want to do that for you,” I hear Him saying here. When God reveals what is dark, in this case my inability to deal with emotional situations, it becomes light like Him. This is great news, but how do we know when we’ve gotten to a place of healthy processing?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Know this, my beloved brothers: let every person be quick to hear, slow to speak, slow to anger; for the anger of man does not produce the righteousness of God. Therefore put away all filthiness and rampant wickedness and receive with meekness the implanted word, which is able to save your souls. -James 1:19–21</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Notice, the author does not say <em>don’t</em> speak in this passage. They certainly advocate speaking, but speak <em>slowly</em> or after time has been taken. Maybe it’s three seconds, maybe it’s three hours, but take time. <em>Anger is not a sin</em>. There are passages that advocate getting angry, but when we do we have to make sure that surge of emotion does not fuel an emotionally charged response. That is what the author is getting at here. It’s OK to express what has gotten you worked up, but do so <em>lovingly</em> (without trying to dear down or apart the other person) when you’ve been able to remove the spiteful and potentially harmful emotion from that response. Allow me to reiterate: <strong>say what you need to say</strong> but once you’ve backed away from the emotional ledge.</p>

<p>I am not trying to advocate responding robotically to the world around, but in a way that is informed by God’s word. We need to “receive with meekness the implanted word.” Plainly, we need to quiet ourselves and listen to the Spirit which is professing God’s word to our souls. In other words, stop taking the responsibility for responding, most often making the situation worse, and let God do the dirty work. However, we need to <em>listen</em>.</p>

<p>I don’t know about you, but I find it both a little maddening and a little comforting that this also comes down to reading God’s word. However, I do find it comforting that I don’t have to bottle up my emotions for fear of unleashing them on my loved ones and hurting some people very dear to me (i.e., my sister). That reaction should come from the Spirit who has been trying to coach my responses since I was five (yes, that was when I believe I became a Christian). What about you? Who will you let respond next time someone triggers a strong emotional response?</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p>Assuming you read my <a href="http://104.193.143.57/~waywar13/ce/2011/06/14/his-name-is-robert-paulson/">last post</a>, yes, this is one more spurred by my favorite movie to date. In case you haven’t gathered, I think a lot. Therefore, my turning on a movie deep as <em>Fight Club</em>, I should expect nothing less than to at least attempt to think into it. Any hopes of a casual viewing were dashed when Brad Pitt’s character, Tyler Durden, utters this line:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“It’s only after we’ve lost everything that we’re free to gain anything.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Despite the glaring lack of sleep, my mind was racing. What do <em>I</em> hold onto too tightly? What am I not willing to lose? What is holding me back in life?</p>

<p>I was not ready for the answer, but it came back to me a booming voice in my heart. “More than you care to know right now,” and I believe it. The better question to ask is what do I <em>not</em> hold onto like a kid on a merry-go-round spinning out of control? I hold onto friendships, love, money and happiness like they’re going out of style.</p>

<p>Each friendship is like a mirage in the desert and I am fighting to not let the sight vaporize back into the haze. Every romantic relationship is my last chance at getting it “right”. Money is something I may never see again if I don’t hold onto it long enough. Happiness is like my opiate for the inevitable pain of life. All of them I strangle until they each in turn slip away.</p>

<p>Tyler Durden’s words are not unlike another quote from nearly two millennia before. “For whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.” sounds eerily similar in my mind (Matthew 16:25). Yes, these are the words of Jesus, but for some reason Tyler’s words ring out louder. For some reason, my heart does not want to hear the Son of God’s call to cast aside the trifling aspects of this existence. No, but Tyler’s words are profound.</p>

<p>Regardless, this is a huge problem in my life. I’m no Midas, therefore everything I seem to touch in this life just seems to break or turn to dust rather than gold. I’m not self-deprecating, I’m being honest. I micro-manage my possessions and relationships and ruin them all beyond recognition. It is merely fact that I need to stop and let go.</p>

<p>Jesus’ words don’t make sense to me, because deep within, I want to make this life as comfortable, pleasant and long as possible. However, He assures me that in so doing, I will only accomplish the opposite. Despite the tendencies of my heart, I have seen these words in action in my daily life. They prove my broken heart wrong time and again. How long will I go on daftly trying to prove the One through whom all things were created?</p>

<p>How long will we continue to hold with a death grip that which we never had in the first place? How long will we continue to occupy ourselves with only the worthless things that fit into our feeble and clumsy hands? When will we let go and just lose ourselves? When will we begin to allow God to give us the invaluable things we could never hope to hold onto by ourselves, let alone attain in the first place? It’s already been far too long, friend.</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p>This weekend, I was watching <em>Fight Club</em> as a means of relaxing in between performances (news flash for some: yes, I was in a play) but had no intent of actually paying attention to the movie. I realize that’s a strange movie to just have playing in the background, but I’ve seen it enough to where I thought I could do that. I was very wrong.</p>

<p>There is one point in the movie where Bob (full name in the movie Robert Paulson), someone Edward Norton’s character (who has no real name) meets early on dies committing an act of corporate terrorism with the group that the Narrator (Edward Norton) and Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) begin with a simple group called “Fight Club”. The other men on the mission bring him into the kitchen and dump him on the table where they then are going to “dispose of the evidence”. This is when Norton vehemently rejects this leading to one of the most poignant scenes in the movie.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“His name is Robert Paulson.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Another member replies, “In death, a member of project mayhem has a name, his name is Robert Paulson.” In death, all we have is the memory of who we were. We have our name which is defined by what we devoted ourselves to and spent our time on in this life.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“And he said to them, ‘Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.’” — Matthew 4:19</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this verse, Jesus has just walked up to Simon Peter and his brother Andrew, two fishermen, and just tells them to follow Him. The depth of this call have never made full sense until thinking about Robert Paulson. Jesus is saying, “I will give you a name. If you leave everything here, I will give you the life of which you could only dream. I will give you things in which to invest that will last forever. Only if you forsake everything you once knew, I will show you how to be adopted into God’s royal family.”</p>

<p>Jesus never needed to say all that. All He said was, “Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.” I don’t know about you, but to me that sounds hugely cryptic and bordering on gimmicky. OK, it’s pretty clever too, but I wouldn’t trust Him. “Who are you to tell me to just follow you?” would be my reaction. But, these men on some level got it. They understood the connotation of all of that, at least to some degree.</p>

<p>Jesus still says that today. In the wind, in the sunshine, in church, in the Bible, He is still whispering those words. But, I’m sure you, like myself, have a better way of making a name for yourself in this life. I’ve got my own 5-year plan that I’m working on right now. Sure, there have been setbacks, but I’ll make something of myself and I’ll do it on my own.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Where you invest your love, you invest your life.” — Mumford and Sons</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In what higher or greater thing can I invest my love than the Maker and Creator of all? To what glory can I sacrifice my life’s purpose that is greater than God’s? I have not found a thing. Yes, I’ve looked and I still look at times. At this point, I don’t really expect to find anything.</p>

<p>My soul know it; God’s purpose is my <em>greatest</em> purpose. If it is not, then He must not be who I think Him to be and I must find the ultimate being in the universe. This could be true, sure, but my soul feels pretty sure on this one.</p>

<p>I want my memory, my name when my soul departs, to be in God and His holy name. What about you? What do you want for your memory?</p>

          <h2><a href="/i-dont-share-your-faith/">i don’t share your faith</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>I think most people agree that Christians can oftentimes be some of the least tolerant and most judgmental people you’ve ever met. I’m pretty sure that all our reactions to the intolerance and judgment was some distinct form of being turned off to some degree at least to the person, if not to the religion as a whole. I know I have had both these reactions at times. Here is where I need to separate myself.</p>

<p><strong>I am this person</strong>. <em>Yes</em>, quietly in my heart I judge Christians, Agnostics and Atheists alike. However, being a Christian myself, I judge the Christians exceedingly harshly. <em>Yes</em>, I am part of the problem. <em>Yes</em>, deep down in my heart I’m as ugly as the rest, if not more so . <em>No</em>, I’m not comfortable with all these facts.</p>

<p>The long and the short of it is that I’m trying to derive self-worth by judging your faith. What is faith, though? Sunday school survey says, “Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen.” (Hebrews 11:1) Now that I’ve established that, what does faith look like? Once again, Sunday school survey says, “So also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead.” (James 2:17) “This doesn’t really answer my question. What does faith look like, so I can create a guidelines for judging?” says my dark heart.</p>

<p>There is a quiet voice that contradicts what I want to believe about James’ words. This passage explains <em>everything</em> I could need to know about faith. Faith is <em>active</em>, compelling us to press forward, but your direction forward does not necessarily look like my pressing onward. In fact, in most cases they may seem completely tangential. This isn’t creating much of a guidelines and my flesh, the baser depths of me, despises this fact.</p>

<p><strong>Faith is beautiful</strong>. It is <em>unique</em>, not to be hidden under a rock, but maybe not necessarily to be understood by all. That’s right, faith is just as unique as the person who possesses it.</p>

<p>If someone you come across does not agree with your faith, do not go running for the hills. Remember, our faith is not meant to please others and cannot be judged by men who cannot see the heart (1 Corinthians 2:11). Our faiths are meant to be shared for sure through actions and words, but each respected. In fact, Proverbs 27:17 says, “Iron sharpens iron, and one man sharpens another.” I’d say we should be <em>committed</em> to sharing our faiths <em>respectfully</em> so that we can all learn and grow from one another.</p>

<p>We don’t talk about religion or politics. Fine then, I’m not telling you to talk about your religion. <strong>Faith is not a religion</strong>, it is an individual <em>relationship</em> with our loving God and Maker. God is just as real as any other person you see walking around this planet, so talking about your relationship with Him should be a totally natural and normal thing to do.</p>

<p>Now, before you go and start burning down church doors, there is a slight caveat to this post. The God you have faith in is relatively well described in the Bible by many accounts. If your faith leads you to burning down abortion clinics, protesting military funerals or other actions that may be considered hateful, you may want to reevaluate the god in which that faith is placed. I may run into some cynics at this point, but the God of the Bible is one of <em>love</em>, <em>grace</em> and <em>mercy</em>. Sure, He did his fair share of smiting particularly in the Old Testament, but I trust deeply that those smote were beyond any other method of recourse and served a higher purpose.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“In this the love of God was made manifest among us, that God sent his only Son into the world, so that we might live through him. In this is love, not that we have loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins. Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another.” — 1 John 4:9–11</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let our acts of faith proceed accordingly.</p>

            <p>I can’t tell you how many movies I’ve seen where the protagonist at the last possible moment is saved from certain doom by <em>that</em> friend. It seems to be a very common theme in movies, but why is that? This fact used to seriously bother me when I was younger because the hero/heroine was not enough on their own to overcome the arch-nemesis or the main obstacle. On their own, <em>they simply weren’t adequate</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I don’t believe it’s strength that makes the man, but the strength of those propping him up.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I believe this theme carries because it is desperately true of our everyday lives. We were created to be in community, because the mountains and valleys of life are simply overwhelming for the lonely, solitary traveler. We need others to share the joys, the pain, the triumphs and the defeats.</p>

<p>I know a friend who has told me on a couple occasions that I “live life well,” which got me to thinking about the statement’s true meaning. I don’t know how to live life better than anyone around me, but I <em>do</em> have something that some of these people do not. I have an astounding support system of family and friends. To reference Sir Isaac Newton, it is because of them <em>I stand on the shoulders of giants</em>.</p>

<p>I have been blessed in a way that is both subtle and very profound. Their contributions to my life are regular, but their impact is massive. <strong>So often, I take these people for granted</strong>. However, the truth of my life is that it is only as capable as those who are there bracing me against the storms of life. I am <em>nothing</em> without them.</p>

<p>This is the way God intended life. Yes, He has enabled me to be empowered by His Spirit, but all too often I mistake this for my putting on the cape of Superman. Truth be told, I am but an organ in the much larger body of believers and I cannot function properly outside of the communal context (1 Corinthians 12:12). Without the rest of the body, an eye is just a mass of goo. (I believe that’s the scientific definition).</p>

<p>Having recently begun a new journey in life through uncharted territory, it has never been more important for me to recognize this pivotal truth. I have had to take inventory and ask if I have the strength to take on this adventure. What I was really asking is if God has given me the necessary structure to keep me from falling flat on my face. He answered quietly and deliberately this weekend.</p>

<p>God does not place us in positions or situations that He has not already given us the necessary support to sustain us (1 Corinthians 10:13). However, we can take it for granted and ignore it. This is when I have gotten myself into trouble. This is when my life falls apart and I feel isolated and powerless. This is when I <em>am</em> powerless.</p>

<p>There are people in my life who have done things that simply amaze me. I recently took the time to step back and just marvel at what God accomplished in their lives. Then I realized, these are the very giants pushing me up on their able shoulders. Right now, I am blown away.</p>

<p>What about in your life? Do you have that support? Do you have those people? If not, I cannot urge you strongly enough to ask the question “why”? I doubt the answer you’ll find is that they just don’t exist. Find them.</p>

<p>Individually, we are mere men. Together, we make giants. Alone, we are lonely and misunderstood. In community, we are accompanied by kindred sojourners and involved in a beautiful exchange of understanding stemming from a grace-saturated honesty. Friend, the choice is yours.</p>

            <p><strong>Never, ever forget these words:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Enjoy the journey and those traveling with you, not just the destination.” — Phil Carnuccio</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a lesson I’ve been learning in earnest for the past few months since reading <em>A Million Miles in a Thousand Years</em> by Donald Miller. It was the focal point of a message I heard this past Sunday at Providence Church here in West Chester. Then, you look at <a href="http://www.jonacuff.com/stuffchristianslike/2011/06/have-no-clue-how-god-will-use-your-story/">Stuff Christians Like</a> today. There is no doubt God wants my heart in this area.</p>

<p>It was especially timely given the fact that I am ending one story that is my internship and jumping off a cliff into another. Honestly, I do not know what this next story looks like in particular, but this blog and my music (in which I dabble) are a part. However, I will not make this journey if I do not have the right support. Looking back at this past year as a supported (getting donations) intern, it is undeniable that life as a whole cannot be survived alone, as it was never meant to be.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Then God said, “Let us make man in our image, after our likeness.” — Genesis 1:26a</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is no mistaking the fact that this is a trinitarian God creating man in His (at the same time <em>Their</em> pluralistic) image. Not to perform a full exegesis here, but it would be preposterous for the author to include the “our” in the verse were it not to intonate a need for others, for <em>community</em>. For those of you who’ve been following along, I may be beating a dead horse, but I do not see how with something so intrinsic and crucial this can be done.</p>

<p>The symbol of the first church was their deep sense of and need for <em>community</em>. The apostles were never scattered until they all went into hiding after the crucifixion. In our times of need, we seek people, not exclusion. I could go on, but that would be redundant.</p>

<p>As I face the precipice of a new journey, I am thrilled and terrified all at once. I do not know the path, nor do I know the destination. All I know is my next step and that God has graciously given me some of the most amazing people to support me along the way when I fall down or stray from my path. <em>This is life</em>. I’m already taken care of and the fear begins to fade.</p>

<p>Dear friend, what is your story? Are you living it <em>actively</em> or postponing it daily? Worse yet, are you going it <em>alone</em>? Again, I repeat the call.</p>

<p><strong>“Enjoy the journey and those traveling with you, not just the destination.”</strong><br />
And never forget to thank God for those fellow sojourners. The road is <em>long</em> and <em>narrow</em>. They are a pure gift from above. <em>Don’t let them forget that either</em>.</p>

          <h2><a href="/dressing-up-in-fathers-clothes/">dressing up in father’s clothes</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>At a very young age, I began to raid my parents’ closet and put on my dad’s business attire (head to toe) and try to imitate him in both dress and stature. This ended very quickly when he was less than pleased that I was wrinkling his crisply pressed suits, but that’s beside the point. The fact is, I perceived that doing so was practicing something to which I was supposed to aspire. It was in my best interest to mimic him in order to learn how to be a mature, cool grown-up (the aspiration of every young kid, I feel).</p>

<p>However, when it comes to God, this apparently does not translate. To my heavenly Father, the Creator of love and all things good, I don’t seem to attribute the same importance. While my dad was significant enough to imitate when I was young, now that I’m older, imitating the Father seems…childish. The voice in my head shouts, “I’m a grown-up now, I don’t need anyone to show me the way! I’ll figure it out myself!” Yet, this seems both immature and pompous. Where do I get off telling God I know love better than <em>He who is love</em> (1 John 4:7)?</p>

<p>I have the perfect example of love pure in the life of Jesus, yet I choose to ignore it constantly. I have been brought into the light that is the eminence of God and yet I choose to hide in the darkness of my <em>lust</em> and <em>idolatry</em>. I am far too easily pleased by lesser things. And constantly I’m looking elsewhere to get my fix. I have a loving Father lighting the path of love for me, but something holds me back. Who is He to say He is right and no other?</p>

<p><strong>Then, it hit me.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Awake, O sleeper, and arise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you.” — Ephesians 5:14</p>
</blockquote>

<p>God has given me the <em>greatest</em> gift I could ever receive. He gave me the opportunity to have an <em>identity</em> in Himself, the the Creator, the ultimate Being, the greatest power of the universe. He gave me the once in a lifetime opportunity to commune intimately with the only perfect thing ever, Himself. He sealed that promise with…<em>Himself</em>. This fact alone means that God’s either pretty high on Himself, or <strong>He could find no greater power to invoke</strong>.</p>

<p>Therefore, I as a part of Him can have no blemish in my entire being as it would conflict with God’s perfect nature. Where there is light, darkness cannot also exist (Ephesians 5:8). I have been brought into a relationship with the Holy and my sin is only a <em>breaking</em> of that relationship. This is why the sexually immoral or impure and the covetous (idolator) have no place in the kingdom (Ephesians 5:5). These are merely examples the church at Ephesus struggled with in particular, but every time I turn from and rebel against God, I am <em>betraying</em> the relationship with the only Father who can love me infinitely and perfectly <em>without fail</em>.</p>

<p>I do not resist the rebellion which seems to sear my insides at times because I feel I must. No, it is an act of <em>love</em> toward the One who loved me first. I resist because He has given me the <em>power</em> in His Spirit. Because of His <em>grace</em>, I am able to seek ultimately to please Him as a showing of my gratitude for the overwhelming gift which He has granted me. Albeit, a gift that I do not have the faculties to fully appreciate, but a gift I know to be <strong>far more than priceless</strong>.</p>

<p>I call myself His son because in the beginning, He called me son and sealed that adoption with the gift of His discerning Spirit to guide me in the imitation of Him. I could not discern the direction of the Spirit were it not for my brain, however, validating the Spirit’s inherent truth. It leads me in the path that brings me to my <em>ultimate good</em> in life, <strong>to love (God and neighbor) and to be loved</strong>.</p>

<p>I have been loved with a surpassing love and given a way to stride toward loving in kind. Out of respect and gratitude, should I not do just that? Because, in the end, <em>doesn’t life just come down to love</em>?</p>

<p><strong>Whom, what and how well do you choose to love today</strong>?</p>

          <h2><a href="/is-love-winning/">is love winning?</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>I have struggled massively with this post. Everything from the content to the title has got me questioning. In continuing this series on the book of Ephesians, I came across the particularly difficult chapter four. I say it’s difficult for two reasons. One, I have seen some of both the ugliest face of Christendom in response to Rob Bell’s <em>Love Wins</em> as well as the the more beautiful in friends and family. Two, I am in the process of understanding the depths of the human condition and all the futility under the sun.</p>

<p>Rob Bell’s latest book, I feel, could be the best worst thing to happen to Christianity in recent memory. However, many people have used it to lambaste him and his followers. I feel there has been a significant rift formed from this one book. Honestly, I don’t understand why. I am not one to talk here. Or maybe I am.</p>

<p>I’m sure everyone has heard by now of Westboro Baptist Church protesting this, that and the other thing. They carry hateful signs at these protests and say hurtful things that truly tarnish the already less than sterling image of Christianity.</p>

<p>What do we do? In true Christian fashion, we hate them back. We fume and we huff and we puff and excommunicate them from <em>our</em> denomination of Christianity.</p>

<p><strong>We are no better than them</strong>.</p>

<p>We become what we hate and play right into a scheme only the devil could concoct. Rather than remedy the situation, we add fuel to the fire and further the negative thoughts people have about us as Christians.</p>

<p>News flash: we are the <em>body</em> of Christ. We are the living, breathing, walking, talking flesh and blood of Jesus. I may be crazy, but I read Ephesians 4:1–16 to read “<strong>as the body, you are to be united in</strong> <strong><em>love</em></strong>”. Last time I checked, the definition of love never mentioned the words hate or division.</p>

<p><strong>Have we become the Corinthians?</strong></p>

<p>Paul then expounds how the church is to go about living in <em>love</em> and <em>unity</em>. I think the first part of his explanation is basically saying, “<em>Stop trying to understand grace, because God’s love is far beyond our comprehension</em>.” I admit that by my reasoning, someone attacks my beliefs I attack them back. This is not love.</p>

<p>We are called to <em>put away all falsehood</em>. If we want to criticize and cut down Rob Bell for taking a risk, read his book for yourself. Go and get a clue what you’re talking about rather than being lazy and relying on second-hand news. However, I don’t recommend cutting down in any form.</p>

<p>We’re called to be <em>angry</em>, get <em>passionate</em> but do not get carried away. Yes, you should get angry that people are protesting gay soldiers’ funerals, but don’t hate the people doing so. Hate the bastardized version of “Christianity” that ignorantly promotes them to do so. Yes, in case you missed it, I said get angry.</p>

<p><em>Build one another up</em>, don’t tear down. Our speech should evidence the presence of the Holy Spirit intimately in our lives. I’m not advocating speaking only compliments, because they would soon feel empty to their recipients. I am, however, saying that love in speech works to push the speaker and listener forward whether in the form of simple truth, spiritual exhortation or challenge or emotional condolence.</p>

<p>Finally, <em>forgive</em> in the way that we have been forgiven thousands upon thousands of times (or maybe that’s just me). Have we already forgotten the vessel of our salvation? Have we forgotten the only hope we have of the deliverance of grace? On my hands and knees, I pray that is not true. Let it at least not be true of you, friend.</p>

<p>Though I am by no means a model citizen for anything I have written about, you had better believe I with every bit of my soul desire for unity in the church through a righteous and sanctified body of believers. However, this will not come about by human effort alone, because we are not capable of heart change. <strong>In the end, it is all about love, God’s love, and love wins</strong>.</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p>I’ve heard a lot lately about twentysomethings like myself who are just floating along after college and how that demographic is alarmingly on the rise. The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/22/magazine/22Adulthood-t.html">New York Times</a>, <a href="http://onfaith.washingtonpost.com/onfaith/panelists/mark_driscoll/2010/08/the_world_is_filled_with_boys_who_can_shave.html">Mark Driscoll</a>, <a href="http://www.relevantmagazine.com/life/whole-life/features/22732-if-40-is-the-new-30-is-20-the-new-junior-high">Donald Miller</a>, <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704409004576146321725889448.html?KEYWORDS=KAY+S+HYMOWITZ">Wall Street Journal</a>, as well as another fellow blogger, <a href="http://thoughtsaboutnothing.com/are-20-somethings-waiting-to-grow-up/">Kyle Reed</a>, have all weighed in on the crisis. I feel it’s now time for me to jump into the deep waters of this murky swamp.</p>

<p><strong>Admittedly, I fit into the group that defines the crisis at hand</strong>. I am in a one-year paid internship, I blog and am in search of the next great opportunity that romances my desire for adventure. I moved back home after graduation last summer to raise support for my internship and in a couple months hope not to be moving back, pending future employment. I have done something not so typical of the stereotypical twentysomething “guy” and that is move away from home and not to either Nashville or the LA/NYC scenes. Honestly, I’ve chosen something far less glamorous than that, but not so radical as join the Peace Corps. or Teach for America, but I digress.</p>

<p>In my first crack at this topic, I nearly butchered it, but my good friend Erik (as usual) helped me find my direction. The problem isn’t that we twentysomethings are refusing to grow up, it’s that we all were forced to “grow up” the moment we entered high school. College admittance has become competitive to the point that the day we enter high school, we’re reverse engineering our lives from 35 so that we’ve planned out the GPA we need to get into the college that offers us the right major and the best chance to get into the career we want. <em>This is at age 14</em> (at least it was for me).</p>

<p>You have a bunch of new teenagers plotting over 20 years down the road when we haven’t even begun to experience arguably the most complicated stage of human development. No wonder there are heaps on stacks of twentysomethings reneging on the lives they planned out and just floating throughout this period of their lives. We never had a chance to be teenagers and college students and just enjoy the ride that is finding our <a href="http://104.193.143.57/~waywar13/ce/2011/05/11/hello-my-name-is/">identity</a> in these years.</p>

<p>I’ve always been a late bloomer, so I hit this phase when I was 16. However, this was when my parents separated which I am in a sense grateful for in all honesty. The fact that they did eventually divorce is unfortunate, but personally, it took from me my very identity. Essentially, the core of how I defined myself was violently ripped from my soul and I was forced to examine with a fine-toothed comb exactly who I was (which I’m still doing over seven years later).</p>

<p><strong>I spent high school running from my identity crisis only to run smack dab into it in college</strong>. It is only because of this disaster that I had the opportunity to look somewhat objectively at the madness that was my life and step back from the ledge that would have led me straight down into a career that I would have soon regretted. Few people seize this opportunity until they’re a few years out of college.</p>

<p>I have not experienced this phenomenon myself, but I think the great quarter-life crisis occurs like this. After a year or a few, people are <em>jolted</em> from their salary-induced status quo by some unpleasant stimulus (I suspect it’s different for everyone) and realize they missed out on their dreams, their very youth. They realize their best laid plans have failed to satisfy themselves and so they jump ship. They run to something, <em>anything</em>, more romantic than their current reality because frankly, it <em>sucks</em>. Their reality and their passion have become mutually exclusive and so, like the child dormant deep down inside, they flee to a sort of dream existence devoid of logic and <em>meaning</em>. There is another biting reality in store, however.</p>

<p><strong>Life isn’t just a whim or a dream</strong>. Yes, we need to dream and dream big, but not <em>every</em> dream is worth following. <em>This is why God gave us a brain</em>. There is a happy medium that can be reached before you hit your thirties. That is, <em>only</em> if we take off the societal blinders we’ve so readily put on years ago.</p>

<p>So, <em>yes</em>, I agree we have a crisis on our hands, but it’s not for a lack, but a <em>hyper</em> sense of responsibility. Before it’s too late, we must realize that our identity is not rooted in our <em>career</em> or the <em>college</em> we went to, but the <strong>God</strong> who gave us the <em>passions</em> that He designed us to <em>follow</em>. Those passions do not fit neatly on a life chart or a career path. They are sometimes all over the map and do not make sense, but they must define our occupational future. If they do not, then what are we <em>really</em> following? Or, should I say <em>whom</em>..?</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p>I have always been a people pleaser, as it’s just a part of my personality. I’ve always sought to please my parents especially, because deep down I don’t know a child who in one form or another does not want to at some point in their formative years. Well, couple these two tendencies with a wild lack of self-image and you have a definite problem. You have a child looking to find self-worth in the constant affirmation of his parents as he alone is not worthy enough (in the child’s eyes, at least).</p>

<p>My spiritual journey that has encompassed the last 5 1/2 years of my life has taught me many things and brought me over many hurdles. I’ve been taken to lows I could hardly wish on enemies and highs that resemble some drug-induced euphoria. Through it all, however, I came to see God as merely a Being to shepherd me through the hard times and keep me safe long enough to press on through the next mire of testing.</p>

<p>These paragraphs seem pretty unrelated, but what if you take the child’s lack of self-worth, compound that by a few years of elementary, middle and high school and then transfer that focus into the spiritual arena? It seems like I’ve taken a step forward, but now instead of getting some of my identity, I am constantly seeking affirmation to gain <em>all</em> my identity. In other words, we’re dealing with a much deeper form of identity. Yes, I try to please God in the constant trials He allows for me to face, so that maybe I’ll earn His favor eventually and at last be worthy to be called His.</p>

<p>Here is where Ephesians 3:11–12 comes in:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“This was according to the eternal purpose that he has realized in Christ Jesus our Lord, in whom we have boldness and access with confidence through our faith in him.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here, the theme of Ephesians is continued. God’s grace is constantly being poured out, but all we need to receive it is the faith which He gives us also (Romans 12:3)! Not only am I worthy to come, sniveling up to the throne of God, I am able (thanks to Jesus) to approach boldly and confidently. There is no room for either if I am trying to seek God’s favor. This must mean that because of Jesus, I already have His favor and that I am able to request God as if I were His <em>son</em>. My identity, therefore, must already be defined to God. In fact, this leads me to wonder if maybe my identity is <em>in</em> Him and I just have yet to realize that fact.</p>

<p>What Paul does next in this chapter is quite poignant in addressing the doubts of the Ephesian church. He wants to keep them from getting discouraged, but instead of exhorting them or lifting them up emotionally or physically, he prays for spiritual blessing. He takes what seemingly is in the physical realm and approaches it from the spiritual. He prays they will be strengthened by the God who gives all families in heaven and on earth their names (identity?!) (Ephesians 3:14–16). He prays that the Spirit would ingrain within their hearts the love of God that they would live out through faith (Ephesians 3:17). Finally, that they would be empowered to grasp the height, depth, length and breadth of that love that cannot be understood by human minds. This, he says, fills with “the fullness of God” (Ephesians 3:18–19).</p>

<p>I need to prove nothing to the God that has graciously given me my name and accepted me into His royal family. There, I am accepted and affirmed perfectly so as to be able to approach my heavenly Father with boldness and confidence. However, when there comes times that I feel discouraged and unworthy (which there have been and will continue to be), I merely need to look toward His love and understand that my identity and worth are rooted in it, which is higher, deeper, longer and wider than comprehension. It’s infinite.</p>

          <h2><a href="/naked-broken-and-beautiful/">naked, broken and beautiful</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>A few weeks ago, I was at a friend’s cabin out in the wilderness of north-central PA. There were four of us in a near pristine setting and it was hard not to see and talk about God in such conditions. Being four men who considered themselves Christians, deep topics were not necessarily skirted around and eventually we came upon the topic of spiritual nakedness. I was more than willing to dive into the conversation, but I have not been able to emerge from it.</p>

<p>Here I am, two weeks later trying to mind my own business and not deal with the issue at hand, when it is presented smack dab in front of my face as I’m reading Donald Miller’s Searching for God Knows What. Except, the “it” that I’m referring to is the connecting piece that makes the topic of nakedness relevant and immediately pertinent in my life. As I’m reading the pages about Jesus’ love for people and his affirmation of these people, I began to tear up uncontrollably. Yes, pretty much any time a guy tears up, the word “uncontrollably” is superfluous, but I use it nonetheless. It hit me as I was reading that I had found the gaping hole in my faith. I know a fair amount of truth about God, but I do not embrace the fact that He loves me <em>infinitely</em>, the only way He knows.</p>

<p>My fear of not being loved is so great that I am paralyzed in my pursuit of being found naked in the presence of God. Hebrews 4:13 assures that there is nothing hidden from God, but I am so convinced that the parts of my soul I hide from everyone are in fact hidden from Him as well. I hide these parts because I feel they are ugly, vile and unlovable. Yet, Jesus’ entire life was spent telling the most unlovable people in society they were indeed lovable, even <em>loved</em> and deeply so.</p>

<p><strong>What if instead of saying there is hope even in brokenness, we said there is hope</strong> <strong><em>especially</em> in brokenness?</strong></p>

<p>Brokenness is beautiful in God’s eyes. God found worth in us before He created the earth. He found worth in us when He sent His Son to atone for our transgressions (in their multitude) against Himself. He found worth in us to bring us into this world and, being that He is unchanging, still finds worth in us today. If we are created in the image of God, then He has not created us without an intrinsic value. Look at the Gospels. Really spend some time in them and you’ll find that the most destitute, trite, down, out and honest people are the people Jesus spent the most time with in His life. Jesus treasured the naked.</p>

<p>Rather than covering up our nakedness in prayer and relationships, let us exult in our nakedness. In nakedness we see weakness, “But he said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.” Therefore I will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may rest upon me.” (2 Corinthians 12:9) Let’s be bold and trust that the God of love is just that. Let’s be bold in the name of God and His crazy love, because naked and broken are truly beautiful in His eyes.</p>

          <h2><a href="/i-am-a-thief/">i am a thief</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>I mentioned <a href="http://104.193.143.57/~waywar13/ce/2011/04/20/ephesians-the-beginning-of-a-journey/">last week</a> that I had started a Bible study focused on Ephesians. In my preparation for chapter 2 this past week, I didn’t realize that I was in for a rough spiritual ride. Yes, I’m still <em>that</em> naive when it comes to God.</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>I have to admit, I’ve spent the past week trying to figure out how the passage could fit into the theme of Easter (the original one starring Jesus and the disciples) without feeling contrived. Once again, leave it to [Reston Bible Church](http://www.restonbible.org/sermons/item/308-a-tale-of-two-thieves?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+RBCSermons+%28Reston+Bible+Church+</td>
      <td>+Audio%29) and their Easter sermon. I might as well just end here and have you listen to the podcast, it was that good.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Luke 23:39–43 has Jesus on the cross flanked by two criminals and here we get some of the dialogue between the men. First of all, the fact that these men are having coherent dialogue is beyond me as I would not be able to string together two blood-curdling screams, let alone sentences. The first thief tells Jesus to first save Himself, then save the thieves. The second thief rebukes the first asking whether the man fears God as they are all facing condemnation, but then reminds the first that Jesus has done nothing to earn His sentencing. It’s a little unclear here whether the second thief understands at this point who Jesus is, but continues to ask Jesus to remember him when Jesus enters back into His kingdom. Here’s where Jesus utters the famous line, “Truly, I say to you, today you will be with me in Paradise.”</p>

<p>So, the first thought that crossed through my mind was, “Which am I?” while the second was, “How does this tie into Ephesians 2?” To answer the first question, (I think you saw this coming) I would have to say that I am most likely the first thief. I’m the one telling Jesus to show me that He can save Himself, then to come save my dying self. In other words, if in the off-chance He is able to save Himself, He could probably find a way to save me. But, I’m not banking on it. And this is just in the physical sense. Don’t get me started on my chronic disbelief that Him dying on a cross was enough for my salvation today on account of who I am and who I’ve been.</p>

<p>The second thief is where we see Ephesians 2 played out to a ‘t’. The second thief had lived a life that was rather unremarkable, but bad enough to lead him to death by crucifixion (the most vile death in the Roman Empire). I hope you see the sarcasm oozing from your screen, because this guy was obviously an enemy of the state. His entire life had led him to this point, so I’d say it’s safe to assume he hadn’t earned much favor in God’s eyes. However, Jesus’ love and mercy even in this man’s last few dying hours rings true. Christ knew as He was hanging on the cross, His multiple requests in Gethsemane not to be crucified refused, that His death would be sufficient for this man’s salvation. He knew full well that His death was the quenching of sin’s insatiable hunger, the ending of its dominion. He knew that <em>He</em> was the Messiah, salvation for <em>all</em> men from <em>all</em> things.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast.” — Ephesians 2:8–9</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The second thief is the perfect example of this passage. He believed that Jesus was enough and on the spot He was saved. <strong>He did</strong> <strong><em>nothing</em> to earn it</strong>. This also goes to prove verses 4 through 7, being that Jesus came down to save sinners (of whom the thief was one) and by no work of our own, God’s mercy is supreme saving us from certain spiritual death so that He could bring more glory to Himself through His grace worked out in our lives.</p>

<p><strong>Father, I belive. Forgive me for my unbelief.</strong></p>

<p>Jesus on Easter proved that God is greater than the power of sin by which I am no longer bound. He drew near on that day as He sacrificed His Son, because my sacrifice could never save myself. I rebel against God daily, but each day His promise of sustenance and salvation is renewed. God saved the day, once and for all and there is no power on earth or in heaven that could change that fact. To God be the glory, amen!</p>

          <h2><a href="/not-given-up-on-me-yet/">not given up on me yet</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>Admittedly, this is a post, though completely unplanned, I know I don’t want to write. This is a post that gets to a place that is a little too close to the chest for my comfort. It tells all too much about my soul and my misconceptions of the Holy. This is a post that when I finish, will remain unresolved because that is what it is currently in my life.</p>

<p>The scariest thing a person can tell me is, “you seem put together,” or some other nonsense like that. I appreciate the sentiment, but you obviously do not know me in the least. First of all, I’m 23 and I don’t believe someone my age really can have <em>anything</em> put together in any sense when you get down to it. Second of all, I am a complete and utter <em>mess</em>. This is something I am beginning to come to terms with as I compose this. Once again, look back at my age and then just take a cursory glance at my past. Between the two of those, you’d see that I am in desperate need of a Savior and probably some good counseling.</p>

<p>I’m sure at this point you’re wondering what is so stinking important about what I’m saying here, and it’s this: <strong>I don’t trust God to provide</strong>. I do not believe down to my very core that He has the love for me to supply the necessary <em>acceptance</em>, <em>affirmation</em> and <em>affection</em>. I know that He can, but I do not trust His motives to continue to pursue a hellion in constant rebellion against the very thing I want and need most. Therefore, I seek it desperately in relationships of all sorts, but primarily in those of the romantic variety.</p>

<p>So, I’ve been in <em>few</em> actual dating relationships, which would seem to invalidate my claim, but I feel it actually strengthens it in this case. What I mean is that while I’ve not had many <em>dating</em> (boyfriend-girlfriend) relationships, I have been <em>involved</em> with a few females. Most of the time, I have gotten physically and/or emotionally involved with a girl and then before things got serious, I backed out because I realized commitment was not was I was actually seeking in that relationship. Most of these relationships, I played the part of stereotypical jerk and wanted only to fulfill my own needs and then left when I felt sufficiently content or guilty. Sometimes they ended in me just walking away thinking I was satisfied, other times, I just felt…dirty. Even today, I come face to face with a relationship and I cannot help but squelch it before it has began because of all I hope it will provide for me. However, I know this as just a fallen aspiration.</p>

<p>How broken am I? Writing this, I am disgusted and want to say that this is not me, but <em>it is</em>. So many times have I tried to distance myself from my soul, but that is both physically and metaphysically impossible. This is who I am and who that person is is a doubting Thomas seeking proof that Jesus actually died on the cross and that His death was enough <em>even</em> for myself. Maybe it was enough the first few times I sinned, but how can it be now?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Consequently, he is able to save to the uttermost those who draw near to God through him, since he always lives to make intercession for them.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hebrews 7:25 asserts that He, Jesus, is able to save to the uttermost or at all times. I suppose this means always, but through <em>everything</em>? However, I see no qualifications or fine print. The author seems to say that Jesus rose again from the grave so that no matter what I did, I could still be saved and cared for regardless. Maybe God intentionally added those passages describing Himself. God’s love and forgiveness is abundant, despite my shortsightedness. He wants nothing more than to rain down His love in a deluge of grace and mercy.</p>

<p>The bottom line is that no one can ever provide for me in the everlasting way that God can. No one has the capacity to do all that He has already done and, being that He’s unchanging, will continue to do. Maybe I just don’t understand the words good and perfect, but what in this world is either, let alone both? God is far better than I give Him credit for and I am so thankful He’s not given up on me yet. Hopefully someday soon I’ll be granted understanding.</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p>So, this past week marked the true beginning of a Bible study I’m starting with some friends. While the blog readership is growing, I felt that my personal growth needed a shot in the arm, so the group going through Ephesians seemed to be the obvious answer to helping maintain a focus in God’s word. Admittedly, I do not spend nearly enough time in the Word, so having to prepare for each week seemed like a great inciting incident to kick-start this effort. I really need to watch what I wish for, however.</p>

<p>This chapter, primarily verses 3–14, have unearthed a few aspects of my childhood I realized abruptly during a quiet time that have not been fully resolved. I was having a tough time going through all the promises and blessings, but could not for the life of me figure out where the hang up was deep beneath my calm surface. That is the moment when God dredged up this realization.</p>

<p>I have always been a people-pleaser and it has always been to the extent of my detriment. This is because I have been trying to please my dad ever since I can remember. I told some of the least believable lies growing up just so I would not disappoint him. My parents separated over 7 years ago and have since divorced, but the most devastating impact of that event was not his absence, but that I was not valuable or worthy enough to warrant my dad sticking around.</p>

<p>I know it was never about me and he has told me many times that he is proud of me, but I am always wary of the least displeasure I may be causing him at any moment. In the back of my head, I think I’m still waiting for him to leave me behind for good. I think just about everyone I know is ready to do the same, however this is also based on my own experience.</p>

<p>I’ve taken this to the point of projecting it on my heavenly Father. I am convinced that God has kept me around for some reason I cannot explain, but is constantly disappointed every time I sin and fail Him. He is gracious, so He forgives me, but then it is up to me to earn my forgiveness. God, how fallen is my young heart?</p>

<p>First of all, Paul asserts in Ephesians that God has given me every spiritual blessing. Every gift that could be imagined (or that can’t be) has already been given to me to enjoy for His glory. Let me emphasize, <em>already</em>.</p>

<p>Second, (without going too deep theologically) He chose me before the beginning of the earth as His. Long before time, He in His wisdom and power decided I should be viewed as <em>holy</em> and <em>blameless</em>. Honestly, I’m not even going to try to understand fully how this works, but God is infinitely wise and must know what He’s doing.</p>

<p>Here’s the curveball in my thinking and that is I have been adopted as a son. God saw me in such a way that through redeeming my evil heart and adopting me as His own forever, He could bring Himself more glory. In other words, He found some sort of value in me. Being that this was at the beginning of the universe, it could not have been based upon any action of my own.</p>

<p>Not only do I have redemption, but in all <em>wisdom</em> and <em>insight</em>, He has lavished His grace upon me and continues to do so daily. God thought all this through. After thinking it all through, He still decided that redeeming me was a good idea. All of this because in the process I could be useful.</p>

<p>It is all part of God’s mysterious plan to redeem all of creation. I play a part in God’s great drama. I’m a story within the greater Story. I don’t know about you, but the honor of playing a part in this masterpiece is one of the greatest honors. Now I ask, for how long?</p>

<p>This is where God blows my mind, or what’s left of it. All these things have been promised to me and that promise sealed with the only thing with which God could seal any promise. <em>Himself</em>. The Holy Spirit has been given to me as both a promise of my inheritance as an adopted son as well as a sort of down payment on that inheritance. Literally, the only thing I have done is hear His word and believe.</p>

<p>In the pursuit of starting a Bible study, I have succeeded in that as well as once again wrecking my perception of both God and the world. I think the bottom line here is that God is far greater than my mind can give Him credit for in a lot of instances. Steadily, He is revealing Himself, but it’s only when He knows I am ready to deal with the mire that is my heart that is standing in my way of believing that particular truth. Here’s to charging ahead and keeping our stories progressing forward.</p>

            <p>Believe it or not, I actually do get excited about laundry day. I like cleaning and organization as they bring order back to my frenetic and disorganized life. However, my room consistently looks like a disaster. While I like beginning laundry and throwing all my dirty clothes into the washing machine, transferring them to the dryer and pulling my clean and warm clothes out of the dryer, I <em>despise</em> folding them. It’s not that I have some traumatic childhood association with folding clothes or that I’m bad at folding clothes, it’s just significantly more effort and time consuming than the previous steps in the process. I get bogged down at this phase and so I let my clean clothes sit in a hamper until I sort through looking for a specific article of clothing that may or may not be in the massive pile.</p>

<p>This may seem like a mundane idiosyncrasy, but I think it’s far more telling about a greater issue in my life than just the laundry and the fact that I’m a bachelor not far removed from college. Making decisions to start in a direction, like starting the laundry, feel great and are typically exciting, but what happens when that euphoria is over and we’re no longer having fun?</p>

<p>It is far easier to decide on a direction than it is to continue pressing on in that direction, but it is the pressing on that proves character. It’s exciting to decide to follow your dreams. In the beginning, you can readily see distance being created from whatever it is you’re leaving behind and the destination is right there on the horizon. At some point, you reach the stage where your destination is merely looming on the horizon, but it’s no longer seeming any closer and your place of origin is no longer seeming any further. It is now that character is tested. It is at this stage that dreams are given up or lived; people are made and broken.</p>

<p>Follow through is something that I find hardest in this life. Right when I am bored with my current adventure, something else is there to catch my eye. It’s been a long and arduous journey and I’m getting nowhere, so I jump ship at the first sight of something more interesting. However, that journey sure enough returns me to the same point and I am left frustrated and unfulfilled. I have done nothing more than spin my wheels and waste what could have been a great story on a lesser one.</p>

<p>The middle of each story is typically characterized by suffering, but suffering leads to perseverance that produces character which fortifies our hope. (Romans 5:3–4) This is the point where we, the protagonist, are facing a challenge and see no possible way we can succeed because the challenge is simply too great. We have to stick with it, not because of the destination, but because of the growth we will inevitably incur in the journey. The destination is merely icing on the cake.</p>

<p>While my example in the outset of this post was trivial, it is not just the growth that keeps us going, but it must also be the fact that we have something, if not everything, of value on the line. This is where my effort falters. I have put little on the line. Whether you are risking your reputation, faith or your very identity, you keep on because you simply do <em>not</em> have another choice. The more we have at stake, though, the greater the opportunity we allow for our individual growth. (Matthew 16:25)</p>

<p>Only when we are willing to give up everything do we allow ourselves the blessed chance to gain eternally more. The only stipulation is that once we have given these things up, we cannot decide when things get tough that we want to run back to them. Let go. He’s still holding on, and tightly.</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p>If you were to meet me today, you might not believe that up until three years ago, I was one of the quieter individuals you’ve ever met. It took me being thrust into the wilderness of Yellowstone for ten weeks to understand that I absolutely loved people and got energy from deep conversation that lasted into the wee hours of the morning in spite of an early workday. It was this summer experience that began my exploration into the realm of deeper friendships and what it looked like to actually be a friend.</p>

<p>No, it has not been an easy journey as I’m here today and looking back, most of the friendships that I’ve had are recounted by the <em>hurt</em> I endured as a result of each friendship. I know I’m not the most consistent person on earth, but the times when I did make efforts in these relationships, those efforts were met with indifference and disinterest. Yet, I felt it my duty as a friend to ice the pain and quietly endure as if answering some nobler calling.</p>

<p>I don’t know what your thoughts are about what I’ve just revealed, but in reading over it, I feel sad and angry. These reactions spring forth because I’m realizing that through my gross misperception of relationships, I’ve wasted lots of opportunities at meaningful relationships and growth.</p>

<p>I spent time yesterday listening again to the <a href="http://www.restonbible.org/sermons/item/288-how-god-speaks">sermon</a> from Reston Bible Church and I’ve immersed myself in Donald Miller’s A Million Miles in a Thousand Years, and it struck me how blatantly <em>wrong</em> my ideas of relationship truly are.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“And let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good works, not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another, and all the more as you see the Day drawing near.” (Hebrews 10:24,25)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let’s face it, we’re all trying to live the best life we can and spread the most love possible. If our lives are stories in which we are the protagonist, being part of the greater Story, we need <em>inciting incidents</em> to advance the plot. We need friendships to push us out of our comfort zones to which we cannot return, so that we must take on risk for the purpose of moving forward in pursuing our natural tendency of restoring the comfort in our lives.</p>

<p>In other words, growth happens in community. “Iron sharpens iron, and one man sharpens another,” from Proverbs 27:17 serves to further this point. In this exchange, <em>both</em> pieces of iron are sharpened. Growth in relationship therefore must be <em>mutual</em>.</p>

<p>For all this to happen, two things must be true of ourselves. First of all, we have to be genuinely looking to roll up our sleeves and <em>immerse</em> ourselves in one another’s lives. We cannot give into the inevitable resistance faced when turning a worthwhile thought or idea into action.</p>

<p>For growth to happen in relationship, we must also be <em>vulnerable</em>. In its bilateral nature, a relationship requires both people to trust and allow each other into the innermost parts of our beings. Without this depth, how can we spur one another on to real <em>adventure</em>? If we do not bear our souls in relationship, then we do not allow the other to share in our pursuits that could potentially end up <a href="http://www.jonacuff.com/stuffchristianslike/2011/03/4725/">risking</a> <em>everything</em> we are.</p>

<p>So you say your life is boring? I know mine has been for a long time, but I recently learned something important. It’s my own ever-loving fault! Our lives are only as interesting as our pursuits. So, if life seems boring to you, get up and <em>do</em> something about it. God has written a beautiful story for you in the context of His Story. It is up to <em>you</em> to actively seek out that story for your life. It’s up to you to take on the <em>risk</em> and trust in the Lord that the reward will be more than worth it.</p>

<p>You are your own protagonist, but like every good story, you need <em>support</em>. You cannot do it on your own and neither can anyone else. Therefore, go and <em>find</em> that support and <em>be</em> that support for others. Only then can we all live lives worthy of our calling in Christ.</p>

            <p>I had a conversation with my mother a couple weekends ago on a rare full-weekend trip home. The fact that we had a conversation is not at all an anomaly, but I think for the first time it focused on the topic of work. As a means of context, she has always been a strong spiritual influence in my life, so I was rather attentive when she said that work had been something God had been working on in her life. The next morning, we went to <a href="http://www.restonbible.org/sermons/item/288-how-god-speaks">Reston Bible Church</a> and the topic was once again broached so I knew I had no hope of ignoring it.</p>

<p>Work has been around since the beginning of time. In the beginning, man was created and placed in Eden so that he could <em>do work</em> in the garden (Genesis 2:15). Man doing work was established <em>before</em> he was warned not to eat the forbidden fruit. Therefore, work has a high regard in God’s eyes. But, what as a Christian is to be my view on work?</p>

<p>I don’t know about you, but I’ve found myself, especially lately, compartmentalizing my work and my ministry. When I’m in the office, I’m simply there to do my job and clock out at the end of the day. Then, when I leave the office, I need to be in “ministry mode”. In case you’re worried, yes, this is supposed to seem as stupid as it sounds to read (silently or aloud). Anyway, my demeanor in the office is polite for sure, but my focus is solely on getting the job done for which I am paid. Only once the work day is done can I turn my attention to being an evangelical Christian. Maybe my first warning sign should have been the fact that I work in a Christian office…</p>

<p>As I’ve already hinted a few times now, this is <em>completely</em> wrong. The first question I should be asking myself is where in the Bible does it say that I should only be a follower of Christ under certain prescribed times and conditions? <em>No</em>, it’s nowhere to be found as I’m sure you already knew or assumed. Also, it seems that my work is rather unilaterally, inwardly focused. Now, I’m not saying that work should not be purposeful, I mean to advocate the opposite, but not one that is so…selfish, really. On the other end of the spectrum, work cannot be unfocused while I entertain thoughts of it being ultimately fulfilling and productive.</p>

<p>First and foremost, work, like any other aspect of life, should be governed by the words, “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind, and your neighbor as yourself.” (Luke 10:27) Work should be focused on loving God and loving our neighbors, or our coworkers, bosses, clients, etc. in this case. I think that this is best accomplished by having a plan for everyone we come into contact with on a regular basis that takes into account our own specific giftings. That involves getting to know each and every one of these people as valuable <em>individuals</em> and relying on the Holy Spirit to show you how you in particular can love them <em>best</em>. I may not think that I am being paid to love others, but what good can I really do in my position if I am not seeking to <em>build</em> the others around me in love? (1 Corinthians 13:1–3)</p>

<p>“So, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.”(1 Corinthians 10:31) If I were to assert that this passage did not include work, I would be a liar and a fraud and should step away from these keys forever. “Practice these things, immerse yourself in them, so that all may see your progress.” This verse (1 Timothy 4:15) means that not only should we do all for the glory of God, but do things with <em>intention</em> and <em>purpose</em>. “Do they not go astray who devise evil? Those who devise good meet steadfast love and faithfulness.” (Proverbs 14:22) With love as our purpose, <em>God will always show up</em>. Let us not create a false dichotomy between our work and ministry, but instead let love <em>saturate</em> all areas of our lives. To <em>Him</em> be the glory. Amen.</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p>This, you could say is a continuation of last week’s post, but taken from a different angle. Last week, I looked at the early Christian Church found in Acts 2. While I wish I could say that I best belong in that church, I cannot. Therefore, I will look at the Church as it is today, but from the perspective of those on the outside looking in. In other words, how does the Church appear to the outsider?</p>

<p>I think about the verse in Acts 2 where it says, they had favor with all the people and people were being added to their numbers daily. I do not see this at all today, but why is this? I’ve gotta be honest here. It’s because I as a member of the body that is the Church, am <em>unloving</em>. I miss the fact that right before the having favor with everyone, the Church was filled with people with <em>glad</em> hearts and who were <em>praising</em> God. Hmm…noticing something missing? How about all the above? I think this is a serious problem. However, as I concluded last week, it’s not up to me to fix this. Sure, I should desire for the problem to be fixed, but other than prayer, which is another post in and of itself, it is not mine to solve.</p>

<p>Where is the other point of view I mentioned? Let’s look at how this plays out for the outsiders and those looking to work their way into the community. <em>They can’t</em>. I see these people and immediately I judge them based on their appearance. The guy who looks rather unkempt, but may be the nicest guy you’ve ever met <em>in your life</em>, yeah, I deem him unworthy of getting to know. Why, because I’m a jerk. More constructively, I secretly want to feel that I am better than <em>someone</em>. I do not seek out those who don’t readily have something in common with myself. That’s far too much work for someone only seeking personal glory. Even personal glory has its limits. Then, I judge those who do seek out others. I judge those going into the places that I’m less apt to frequent. Conversely, I judge those who don’t go to the places or do what I do when I do actually attempt to seek out people. I’m just going to say it here, the greatest commandment isn’t worth the value of the paper it’s printed on. This is what my actions convey.</p>

<p>If I am to portray Christ to the world, then here’s what He must be. First of all, He’s highly apathetic. He’s so apathetic, He might as well be hateful of others. He’s self-consumed. The only person He cares about is Himself. Jesus must only care about those who’ve somehow broken through the thick ice and become His best friends. Really, He’s friends with people who continuously keep trying to get to know Him without any reciprocal initiative. Jesus also must have played it safe, only going to places that would be considered wholesome and safe. He never hung out in potentially shady places with people society looked down upon, <em>ever</em>. Finally, Jesus was friends with everyone because He <em>never</em> rocked the proverbial boat. Basically, Jesus was about as bland, white and American as anyone could hope or imagine.</p>

<p>I don’t know about you, but to me, a faith placed in <em>this</em> Jesus seems less than inane. Who is this valium-induced caricature of a religious leader? It must be the suburban white boy-ness in me coming out. Last time I checked, Jesus was very active traversing the countryside speaking and seeking out crowds (Matthew 4:23). All over the Gospels He is going here and there, healing (even on the Sabbath, gasp!), teaching and loving. Even the rich man who had kept all the commandments, but was attached to his wealth, it says Jesus loved him (Mark 10:21). Actually, just search the phrase “Jesus loved” and you’ll get an idea that there is evidence all over the Gospels that Jesus loved <em>everyone</em>. <em>Everyone</em>. Jesus was also accused of being a glutton and a drunkard. Why? He hung out with the gluttons and drunkards (Luke 7:34). That verse also mentions tax collectors. In today’s society, Jesus might have well hung out at whore and crack houses. In that society, Jesus could not have spent time loving anyone lower in social status, including the Samaritan woman at the well (John 4:1–45). Finally, Jesus was a revolutionary unafraid of rocking the boat. Have you read about Him cleansing the Temple recently (Matthew 21:12–17)? Jesus came to shake things up…a lot (Luke 12:51).</p>

<p>The point I’m trying to drive home here is the Church is unwelcoming today. Why? Because the people that make up the Church are unwelcoming. If we want to see the Church change, we first have to start with ourselves. I can pray all I want for God to be conforming it to the bride of Christ she is to be (Ephesians 5:25–27), but that will not come about unless I myself am working to become the change I seek. In the same breath that I am praying to see change in the Church, I will be praying for God to work on my own heart, constantly conforming it to one of obedience and meekness, seeking His glory first.</p>

            <p>By means of an introduction to this week’s post, I must issue a confession. I wanted so badly for this post to serve as a wrathful shot across the bow of what I see as the complacent Christian majority. Nothing would have pleased me more at first than to visibly ruffle some feathers and receive some angry feedback in response. That would surely help to bring about some change! No, I cannot do that. As much as I still might like to incite a revolt within the church, anger is not the match for this fuse. Instead, this post is a desperate plea to a generation seeking change. This post is a siren singing a tale of community, but not just any. It is a true community from the earliest days of the Church dripping of dedication to learning, caring, fellowship and worship.</p>

<p>It was Friday when I got a call from a very good friend of mine. It went like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Hey man, what’s up?”<br />
“You sitting down?”<br />
“No. Why?”<br />
“Chris died last night.”<br />
“Holy…Wow. Tell me it didn’t happen the way I’m hoping and praying it didn’t.”<br />
“Yeah.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My mind began racing and after the initial shock had worn off, the anger set in. His death appeared to have been self-inflicted. The question I could not shake was how could <em>they</em> let him?! How did <em>they</em> let that sneak under the radar. It was all the community’s fault. That’s when it hit me. <em>How dare I</em>? Where is the real problem here? The only answer I could make sense of then and still now is that the real problem is not an isolated event, but one that is far greater reaching than I’d like to think about. The problem is that the working definition of community is lying out in a field in the middle of nowhere shot dead and rotting in an open field.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“And they devoted themselves to the apostles’ teaching and the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and the prayers. And awe came upon every soul, and many wonders and signs were being done through the apostles. And all who believed were together and had all things in common. And they were selling their possessions and belongings and distributing the proceeds to all, as any had need. And day by day, attending the temple together and breaking bread in their homes, they received their food with glad and generous hearts, praising God and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added to their number day by day those who were being saved.” <br />
-Acts 2:42–47</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Acts 2 church is <em>the</em> definition of community! Look at them. There is devotion, praying, care, love and <em>messiness</em>. Yes, I would argue messiness in this passage. The phrase “And all who believed were together and had all things in common,” does not mean we had a bunch of lemmings playing follow the leader. No, it means that these people were living life, <em>every</em> aspect of it, <em>together</em>! Everyone was so entrenched in the nitty gritty details of one another’s lives that they “had all things in common.”</p>

<p>How many times do I see people in church or talk to them on the phone and the accepted answer to my question of, “How are you doing?” is something along the lines of, “OK,” or, “Not bad,” or some other two-word sentence? I’m ashamed to say that would be the vast majority. Since when have people become one-dimensional beings capable of only eating, sleeping and movement? Life is far too complicated for there to ever be a short answer to that question. I know I answer with one or two word responses when people ask me the same question and I stop to think why. It’s typically not because I don’t want to talk; it’s quite the opposite. I want the other person to show they care. I want them to ask explicitly. This is not the first time I find myself to be a hypocrite.</p>

<p>As a side note, no, the first Christians were <em>not</em> communists. Note, it does not say they were selling all their possessions. It reads “…they were selling their possessions and belongings and distributing the proceeds to all, as any had need,” meaning they sold <em>some</em> of their possessions, but gave to <em>all</em> who were in need. Also, the phrase “apostles’ teaching” refers to teaching <em>and</em> the sharing of faith.</p>

<p>Here is what I see missing in my own life, and maybe you can agree. First of all, I do not believe prayer to be the <em>essential</em> link between me and my Savior and His guidance and strength. I do not view community as it was meant to be: <em>a caring, joyful and transparent fellowship</em>. I also do not see my material possessions the same way as Gerhard Krodel when he said, “What we do or do not do with our material possessions is an indicator of the Spirit’s presence or absence.” I agree with the idea that the first church “with constant intimacy, exultant joy and transparency of relationship they enjoyed the graces of Messiah’s salvation in a true anticipation of his banquet in the kingdom,” however cognitively that seems impossible in my life today.</p>

<p>This I feel is horribly telling of my heart. I feel this lack of faith is the undesirable result of a deep-seated problem on the personal level. Honestly, here is my roadblock. Here is where my intellect reaches an end. I do not know how to change this about myself and maybe that is just the point. Maybe this community I seek like the holy grail of the Church today is not attained by the means of the mortal human. Despite my lack of knowledge in this area, I do know for sure, this change begins <em>today</em>. Why? Because it must. I leave you with this from Charles Talbert, “As empowering follows petition, so evangelism and Christian unity or community follow Pentecost. The empowering, moreover, is repeatable. So pray!”</p>

<p>R.I.P. Chris</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p>I’m currently ambivalent about the weather conditions down here as I’m away for “work” in Florida. We are in the middle of a thunderstorm with a tornado watch in effect. I’d love to be on the beach enjoying some warm sun rays, but I appreciate this time to sit down and reflect on my experiences of the past few days. The distinct focus of this week has been on sharing one’s faith. There is a lot wrapped up in this topic and I hope that I can succinctly express it all in one post.</p>

<p>Honestly, the thought of “sharing” my faith or evangelizing as some might call it <em>scares the ever-loving crap out of me</em>. There are multiple reasons for this, but to keep it brief, my own insecurities in my ability to communicate clearly, my overwhelming desire to be accepted and the number of times I’ve seen or heard about evangelism going…well, poorly. In case you haven’t gathered yet, I’m a whore for acceptance. If the language offends you, I apologize, but there are many things I’ve sacrificed (not the least of which morals) for acceptance’s sake. Also, I can be the champion of speaking vaguely about things especially when I’m caught up in my desire to be accepted. I can gloss over the more controversial aspects of my point, the most crucial aspects often, in order to keep the other person’s interest in the conversation and avoid disagreement. Finally, let’s face it, I think we all get a little uneasy when someone mentions the word “evangelism”. I don’t know your mental process, but I immediately think of street corner “preachers” spouting condescending messages of fire and brimstone condemning every passerby to hell for some perceived shortcoming or another. I don’t want to be lumped in with <em>those</em> people.</p>

<p>I’m learning that the first side of the pendulum (in no particular order) people tend to swing toward is the abrasive approach where they overwhelm the listener in a form of <em>shock-and-awe</em> approach. These people go into the conversation preparing for it like a soldier going into war. From the moment they say, “hi,” to the final word, they are in the conversation guns blazing tossing spiritual grenades ensuring they have shared the Gospel in its entirety in each and every conversation. The other person’s point of view, beliefs or personhood all are irrelevant. The conversation is simply tactical; get in and get out, eradicating unbelief in their wake. Far be it from me to call these people wrong, because there are people who respond best to having their luxurious cage rattled, and hard. However, I don’t feel this works on average in a postmodern society built on individuality and philosophy.</p>

<p>The other side of the pendulum that I have seen (and, unfortunately, find comfort in) is a sort of universalist approach. Here, the “evangelist” is cautious to make any definitive statement that might alienate the other person. They are all about the other person’s spiritual background, experiences and point of view to the point where their own is relatively inconsequential. They merely are a friend to the person at the cost of their own spiritual identity for the sake of “preserving” the relationship. This person provides and under-defined picture of their own faith and end up not sharing their faith at all. In fact, they aren’t sharing at all, but absorbing and providing a false sense of agreement in the relationship (spiritually, at least). Once again, I’m not saying this approach is altogether wrong, as some people really just need to get their views out and understand better what it is they truly believe in the first place before they can go refining that view. And of course, this doesn’t often accomplish the purpose of explaining the individual’s belief and does not provide for much more than a one-sided conversation which few people I feel are really looking for in the spirit of continual mental stimulation.</p>

<p>Here’s my perceived happy medium. Sharing in any context has to be a mutual exchange. Sharing implies there is some form of relationship. Therefore, I feel sharing should be the cultivation of a relationship, even one that started five seconds prior. If I am sharing about a God who I believe to be a good God, a God of love and grace, then my method of sharing Him should be a mirror reflection of that God. In following, I need to seek to understand the person and appreciate who they are first as a human being. The purpose of these conversations is not to <em>convert</em> the other person, again it’s to <em>share</em>. Get to know how they think, what they think, their story, and just what makes them who they are like any other friend you have had in your life. I think it comes down here to a matter of motivation. The point is not to “add one more to the Kingdom”, but to value the other person and show that as an outpouring of love from the God who supplies it in abundance we care significantly for their eternal well-being. The most important thing here is that we are <em>caring</em> for the other person. There is no question of “did I do enough?” because it is not our job, nor is it in our ability to be able to change hearts. There is no part of this act that is thrust upon the shoulders of the Christian believer in this situation, but there is a confidence in God and the Holy Spirit (Galatians 1:10). The believer has to be going in with the mindset that they are stepping out <em>lovingly</em> in <em>faith</em> to have a <em>real</em> conversation whose result is <em>entrusted to God</em>.</p>

<p>My view of being an “evangelistic” Christian, in short, has been violently shaken this week. It has not been without an inkling of reticence on my part, but in fact it’s proved <em>liberating</em>. Evangelism, or sharing (as I feel is obvious at this point that I prefer), is not a <em>weight</em> that I must bear as a Christian, but an outcropping of love whose source is the trinitarian God of love and grace (1 Corinthians 3:7–8). It is sharing what I can never lose as a means of expressing the ultimate concern for others that a person can have in this life. Eternity is a <em>long</em> time, so why should one’s eternal well-being not be a significant concern? Most importantly, sharing is <em>personal</em> and <em>caring</em>. Sharing is relational and a respectful conversation that celebrates the characteristics that make each person unique. It is a conversation that is both fulfilling and insightful into both the spiritual and personal realms that provides a safe and encouraging environment to swap world views challenging both and pushing each party toward a better understanding of God and life as a whole. <strong>Evangelism is beautiful</strong>.</p>

          <h2><a href="/rest-not-to-put-you-to-sleep/">rest: not to put you to sleep</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>I felt this post may have been hastily conceived when asked yesterday what this week’s topic would be. That of course was until I was forwarded an email advocating something along the lines of what had been thought ill-conceived. I’m currently launching a campaign in my life to be more responsible and disciplined and a big part of that is getting rest. It is such a simple concept (getting rest) that it doesn’t translate in my head oftentimes.<br />
Not only is rest a good idea in general, but it’s also biblical. “Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.” says Exodus 20:8. This command helps make up one of the Ten Commandments. The explanation follows in verses 9 through 11:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Six days you shall labor, and do all your work, but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the LORD your God. On it you shall not do any work, you, or your son, or your daughter, your male servant, or your female servant, or your livestock, or the sojourner who is within your gates. For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested on the seventh day. Therefore the LORD blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is obviously a big deal if it is included in the Ten Commandments, but I find it a little dubious and easy to ignore. What does this commandment particularly mean? I go to church on Sundays and don’t go into the office or do work of nearly any other kind on that day. Isn’t that enough?</p>

<p>In case you couldn’t already guess where I was going with this, <em>no</em> it’s not at all. There is no way this would be in the bible if it were so simple and there is no way it would be included in the all-important Ten Commandments if this weren’t a bold statement about God Himself. Sorry, that last assertion is another discussion altogether, but try to work with me on this one. This life was never meant to be a set of do’s and don’ts, so I don’t aim to pretend it is here and now.There has to be a “logical” explanation here somewhere.</p>

<p>Despite my desire to be self-sufficient, I believe I need rest simply for the reason that I need God. In other words, I can at least cognitively admit and understand that the only way in which I can truly rest is when it comes from God. It simply is not my personality to be resting sufficiently and often when I do settle down and try to rest, I <em>don’t</em> feel rested. In fact, most of the time I decide to sleep in, I end up feeling <em>more</em> tired than I would have otherwise. All that to say, I can’t just will myself to rest. Maybe you’re different, though.</p>

<p>I’m not just talking about sleep, I’m talking about true <em>rest</em>. I’m referring to a rest that encompasses mind, body and soul. If I can’t even rest my body well, there’s no way I can even get started on the mind, let alone the soul. Have you ever experienced this kind of rest; the rest spoken of in Matthew 11:28–29? I have in fact enjoyed this rest, but I know that the times it actually did happen, it was not of my own ability or will. The nature I feel of my soul is to seek and wander. I do not know how I can control it whatsoever, let alone force it to rest. This is where Jesus says in verse 29 to take His yoke and there we’ll find rest for our souls. If it is my soul’s nature to wander, then this must mean that in Jesus my soul finds contentment and satisfaction enough to allow for it to desire to rest. I don’t know about you, but I’m pretty sure my mind just got blown as I’m typing. If in Christ my soul finds rest, then what am I doing wasting my precious time on all this other garbage that takes me away from rest?!</p>

<p>This post has been a little frenetic as is characteristic of my life recently, but it’s covered rest: the basis for, the source and what true rest actually is. Now that I’ve rambled on and taken valuable moments of your time, it’s your turn. <em>Is</em> there a basis for rest? If so, where do you see it? In what do <em>you</em> find rest? What does rest <em>actually</em> mean? Or maybe you disagree categorically.</p>

          <h2><a href="/what-is-freedom-1dbda20f375/">what is freedom?</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>I think the title of this post really says it all. I read Ephesians 4:17–30 the other morning and the question of “what is freedom?” continues to ring out in the sanctum of my mind. I know myself to be free in Christ, but what does that really look like? Is it a freedom from..? Is it freedom to..? It doesn’t help that I know my perception of freedom has been constantly changing over the past 7 or so years.</p>

<p>Freedom means liberty. This was the idea on which I operated the first few years I was brazen enough to explore the concept in my latter high school days. Sin now, but don’t worry because all your sins will be forgiven so long as you ask Christ to do so. Ephesians 1:7 proclaims that we have forgiveness in the blood of Christ as His followers. However, I eventually ran into this roadblock, “What shall we say then? Are we to continue in sin that grace may abound? By no means! How can we who died to sin still live in it?” (Romans 6:1–2).</p>

<p>OK, so that wasn’t going to work, but that brings me hardly closer to what freedom truly is. On that note, I’m just going to enumerate a few key things I’ve learned freedom <em>not</em> to be. First and foremost, freedom is not an absence of responsibility as then it has been reduced to a mere slavery to indulgence. Freedom is also not a lack of care or concern as that is just ignorant self-absorption. Finally, freedom is not to be hoarded. Freedom under this condition is a timid liberty that is not free at all.</p>

<p>We have been freed for freedom. Freedom is not a transference of slavery from one death-inducing idol to another. I am not free from self-consciousness to be shackled to pleasure in the same breath. Instead, freedom is submitting as Christ did under the authority of the Father. Freedom is a commitment to life. What is a life that is not free? Pardon the leading nature of that question, but I think you get my point here. The underlying fact of freedom is that we as humans created in the image of God (following the example of God in flesh Himself) <em>must</em> submit to the authority of <em>something</em>. Therefore, why not submit to the only truly good and loving master that there can ever be?</p>

<p>These are merely the ever-changing thoughts that have been informed by but a couple short decades on this earth. They are inherently flawed, but maybe they’re not completely off-base. In any case, what are your thoughts on the matter? What is freedom to you? What is it not?</p>

          <h2><a href="/lost-in-the-middle-of-the-social-media-sea/">lost in the middle of the social media sea</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>As this post’s title alludes, this will be another post on my perceived shortcomings of social media. This has become a hot-button issue for me in the past few weeks simply because <em>it just keeps coming back</em> in conversations every couple days. I will try not to repeat too much from last week, while drawing most of the content by means of going even deeper personally. Here goes nothing.</p>

<p>I firmly believe social media was borne out of a desire to manifest man’s proclivity toward narcissism on a global scale…or at least a broader scale. I’m not saying that social media cannot be used for good; look at John Piper’s <a href="http://twitter.com/JohnPiper">twitter</a> account or International Justice Mission’s <a href="http://facebook.com/internationaljusticemission">facebook</a> page. However, these are exceptions rather than the norm. Occasionally, I am prompted to change my status on facebook to something biblical or I tweet something promoting a cause in which I believe, but I can’t say this happens more often than once every blue moon.</p>

<p>I log into facebook (from here on called “the ‘book”) and it asks me what’s on my mind. I log into twitter and it asks me “what’s happening”. Sadly, I type to them like I would into an online diary what is on my mind and what’s happening in my life. Then it gets posted on the internet for all the world to see. <em>As if my thought or current activity should matter to the internet as a whole</em>. Slyly, both websites have allowed me to reason away my self-absorption as a harmless status update. I’m here to say right now that I can feel my ego grow bigger with each press of a button. Every time I hit “Tweet” or “Share”, I can feel the rebellion against an outward focus rise up like a destructive fire.</p>

<p>I keep the ‘book so I can stay some semblance of “in touch” with friends from whom I’m geographically removed. However, I use it so my status updates will come across my friends’ news feed and they will react to what I’ve just shared. That is not a relationship, it is a one way mirror. However, I’ve recently become fed up with the ‘book and its normally useless nature in my life.</p>

<p>I keep twitter so I can stay in touch with the friends I have that don’t use the ‘book frequently enough for my liking. I use it to increase followers and build a social media domain in collaboration with the ‘book. I’m also fascinated with some of the thoughts that pop into my head and I toss back and forth between me and myself. For those of you keeping score, <em>yes</em>, this is just another form of unadulterated <em>pride</em>.</p>

<p>Maybe you are more successful at using social media for a positive outcome than I am, but I am truly struggling to see its benefits right now. I’m not more connected, I’m really more content with being alone because I’m “<em>connected</em>”. I’m never alone, but even when I’m with people, I’m almost as fascinated with the thrilling silence of the internet as I am the ongoing relationships in front of me that I claim to care about most in life.</p>

<p>There you have it. I’ve gone and spilled the beans and now you know the crux of my hatred (yes, hatred) of social media. I hate social media because I don’t know how to use it with out abusing it. Perhaps there is someone out there reading this that could give a few pointers, but maybe we all abuse social media in our own ways.</p>

          <h2><a href="/the-anti-social-network/">the anti-social network</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>I know I’m not the first person to pose these thoughts, but that doesn’t diminish the passion I have attached to them. Honestly, it’s taken me several back and forth conversations in my head to finally stumble upon a conversation with family last night that finally birthed a coherent topic for this post. I was honestly dead-set on at least 5 different topics until I was heavily prompted to revisit this one in particular. I don’t remember when I first broached this oh so sacred and oft overlooked problem that I see, but I’m back for round two with the anti-socialism that has been created as a result of technology. I would say the primary parties responsible for this blatant problem are Facebook, Twitter and (with a hearty serving of irony) blogging.</p>

<p>Honestly, let’s think about the reasons both Facebook and Twitter came into being. The fact is, they both derive value from our own tendency toward narcissism. OK, maybe they only play on my own narcissism, but they do an amazing job at it. Come on, who really cared about what I was doing this very minute before either of these? They are merely enablers that feed this idea that what I’m doing right now is of any importance outside of myself and maybe the people in my immediate proximity? For my own ego’s sake, don’t answer that…</p>

<p>Never have we had so many outlets to communicate with one another, to the point now where we actually have to <em>fight</em> to converse in a deeper and meaningful way. How easy is it to just text your friends to catch up or post on their wall or tweet at them to catch up on their lives? A few button pushes and DONE! It actually takes time to call or go all the way to <em>see</em> that person in the flesh. I mean, I feel myself becoming more and more like the computer which has now become a physical extension of my being. I can’t be separated from either my computer or phone for this reason.</p>

<p>I’m not in the business of villainizing or championing any technology here, but again I know I am not the only person who recognized this violent shift that was catalyzed by the restriction to expressing oneself completely in 140 characters when text messaging came out. Now, that has been extended to Twitter posts. I feel this neutering of true human interaction is now being combated with technology like Skype, which is a brilliant correction back toward a <em>social</em> community. What’s brilliant about it is the fact that you have every benefit of a conversation in person other than the ability to incorporate the sense of touch. This is even better than the phone, which I admittedly <em>hate</em> to use for the very purpose of enjoying the ability to read body language.</p>

<p>Without going on forever, <em>give me my community back!</em> I have certainly fallen prey to the ease of interacting with my computer screen which has both inhibited significantly my ability to express myself verbally as well as value through constant pursuit personal and deep relationships. Sorry, but Facebook and Twitter are about as deep as a wading pool. You have to make the decision for yourself, but I believe that I <em>need</em> community almost as much as I need my Provider and Savior. Why not <em>fight</em> to live the life for which we were designed (Genesis 1:26; Hebrews 10:24–25; Mark 9:50; John 13:14, 34–35; 15:12, 17; Romans 12:4–5, 10, 16; 13:8; 14:13…<em>etc</em>.)?</p>

<p>As a sort of P.S., I want to assert the fact that I struggle with this problem just as much as, if not more than, anyone I know. Please don’t think that I am in any way trying to call anyone out in a backward, passive-aggressive manner.</p>

<p>Cheers,<br />

          <div class="entry">
            <p>So, after several months of still attempting to find my way as a blogger on this site, I am yet again embarking on a different path. This post should take a little more of a conversational tone than previously encountered on my blog. To be blunt, it’s hard to religiously maintain blogging when in a perceived vacuum. There is little point to a blog that isn’t for a good greater than my own narcissism. In this spirit, I set forth once more and continue to explore the world of blogging. Maybe this is just another sign that I’m not a blogger, but in my cautious (at times) nature, I will give it some time.</p>

<p>That out of the way, I want to spend the rest of this post contemplating trusting in God. Why? Obviously, I’m struggling at least a little even in this post. Proverbs 3:5–6 definitively states, “Trust in the LORD with all your heart, and do not lean on your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge Him, and He will make all your paths straight.” Seems pretty simple, and (sorry) <em>straight_forward but that’s not at all been my experience. There’s a distinct reason I go by the pseudonym “The Wayward Journeyer”. My paths have _never</em> been straight. But, to what do straight paths refer?</p>

<p>Despite my 23-year-young self, I have to acknowledge the overwhelming probability that straight paths do not mean smooth sailing as any cursory glance over the Bible reveals. Even at this reality, my heart rebels and does not want to accept this without challenge. Here is where I tangibly experience the tension that is living <em>in</em> this world, but undeniably not being <em>of</em> it. I think it is moments like this I am most assured that this earth is not my home.</p>

<p>However, my rebellious nature does not want to find a home. I do not want to take refuge in the infinite, unchanging and good being that I dumbly refer to as “God.” Yes, I’m a little disappointed right now with the confining nature of the human tongue and especially that of the English language. As I was saying, I know cognitively that I can trust in God because He is good and unchanging, therefore He will always be good. Cognition, however was the first symptom of the Fall. Cognition means nothing; it is only there to reveal how far fallen I am from the God of grace. I have every reason to trust wholeheartedly in this God, but I take near every opportunity to turn away in blatant rebellion.</p>

<p>Now that I’ve taken all this real estate to inspect and infer, here’s where I turn and ask those wiser than myself a question or two. One, how completely can we be expected to submit and trust in God given our human nature? Two, when we do trust in Him, what actually get straightened out in our lives?</p>

            <p>I finished reading Knowledge of the Holy by A.W. Tozer, culminating a months long process (yes, I’m a painfully slow reader) just the other day. If you haven’t read it or even heard of it, I would highly recommend it. For the average reader, it’s a quick and painless but very powerful read focused on what we can and should know about God. I say all this so I can now say that this is wholly inspired by this book. This post is meant to both be a gross under/overstatement based on the contents of this book.</p>

            <p>So this may be a rather cheap way of catching up on my blog posting, but bear with me, please. Alright, I don’t like top (pick a number) lists (or lists in general) as much as the next person, so the thought of creating my own list was somewhat repulsive to me. However, I do love music and truth be told, was looking for something to give a little extra oomph to 2011. Therefore, I could think of no better way for myself than to make a playlist. The original playlist was about 80 songs long, so I was not running low on choices, however I’m terrible at objectively paring down lists because of sentimental ties to the various elements. Well, after listening all day at work yesterday, in the car and at the gym, I finally have it. So, without further ado, here is my “‘11 Torches” (in no particular order):</p>

<p>1) “Light Up the Sky” — The Afters</p>

<p>2) “Savior” — Andrew Ripp</p>

<p>3) “Hello Hurricane” — Switchfoot</p>

<p>4) “See the Light” — Green Day</p>

<p>5) “The Cave” — Mumford and Sons</p>

<p>6) “Our Voice Is a Weapon” — Andrew Zipf</p>

<p>7) “Show Goes On” — Lupe Fiasco</p>

<p>8) “I Want Something to Live For” — The Rocket Summer</p>

<p>9) “Blink” — Revive</p>

<p>10) “All of the Lights” — Kanye West</p>

<p>11) “Monster Monster” — The Almost</p>

<p>12) “Ain’t Killed Me Yet” — Eric Church</p>

<p>13) “Closer to the Edge” — 30 Seconds to Mars</p>

<p>14) “On and On” — Chasen</p>

<p>15) “Won’t Turn Back” — Needtobreathe</p>

<p>16) “Fed Up” — AM Taxi</p>

<p>17) “Let It Go” — Zac Brown Band</p>

<p>18) “Ready to Start” — Arcade Fire</p>

<p>19) “Na Na Na (Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na)” — My Chemical Romance</p>

<p>20) “Lot of Leavin’ Left to Do” — Dierks Bentley</p>

<p>Bonus:</p>

<p>21) “Light Up the Darkness” — The Bridge Band</p>

<p>22) “Wake Us Up” — REILLY</p>

<p>I know, this list has a notable case of ADD, but it’s only as good as its creator. If there are a couple artists you don’t recognize, don’t worry, I may not have either up until a couple days ago. So, the bonus was my caving in to the fact that I could not get rid of certain songs because of the tie I have to them, so my list of 20 has 2 “bonus tracks”. Please note, there are several great releases of 2010 that I was forced to leave off this list not because of quality, but because they didn’t fit my theme. Also, if you have any recommendations, please don’t hesitate to post a reply. On that note, happy listening!</p>

            <p>No, this is not a Nike commercial. Apparently, the cloudiness of the day has also overshadowed my creativity. After last week’s post and having taken a dip in the Atlantic Ocean this past weekend, I think it’s time for a slight change of gears for this blog. I’m tired of feeling like my state of being is dictated by the season or weather (ironically, I <em>love</em> precipitation). So, today, I mix things up a little.</p>

<p>By means of possibly disclosing too much, I’m tired of this depression I’ve been experiencing. I can’t tell if it’s caused by the bitter winter or just life itself, but its welcome has been thoroughly worn out. In the spirit of recognizing the brevity and value of life, it’s simply time to move on. Yes, I have difficulty with follow through, so the words “move on” sound great and excite me, but the implication of effort and work is just enough to give those two words a daunting and unsavory connotation in my mind. However, what is far stronger is the empowering I am coming to terms with that I have in the Spirit. I’m not condemned to stagnation in my own stew, if you will. Honestly, I don’t think it’s very flattering to God if His children are all just “hanging out” and not progressing in life.</p>

<p>“No temptation has overtaken you that is not common to man. God is faithful, and He will not let you be tempted beyond your ability, but with the temptation He will also provide the way of escape, that you may be able to endure it.” Leave it to Bible Gateway to come to the rescue and provide fuel to my fire with 1 Corinthians 10:13. I think this passage really speaks for itself. I am not doomed to succumb to my sin. There is always a way out. I may not choose to see it, but the power of the Spirit working within me will always point me toward that exit and lead me to the victory that God desires. Really, our victory is His victory as it points in these times toward His glory, which is (take it or leave it) our ultimate purpose.</p>

<p>“Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight, and sin which clings so closely, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us, looking to Jesus, the Founder and Perfecter of our faith, who for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is seated at the right hand of the throne of God.” (Hebrews 12:1–2) I constantly come back to this passage. I feel there is so much wrapped up in these simple and straightforward lines of scripture. I may regret later using this terminology, but this is a Truth bomb. BOOM! Right now, it beckons me to leave behind the tired and broken nature of yesterday and set my gaze forward, never looking back. “Move on!” I hear the Spirit say, “There is so much more for you ahead, but you’ll never get there carrying all the weight of your past.” So, like the ice off my car this morning, I’ll let it “all fall like a million pieces” (credit: Newsboys).</p>

<p>There we have it. We are always given an escape and we are called to escape and keep running like we stole something. But seriously, think about that last part. That’s kinda grace..? I’m not following that rabbit hole, but I’m leaving behind my sin of self-righteousness as there’s nothing I can do to “fix” my past transgressions. I invite you to join me in leaving the “dead to bury their own dead” and find a little enjoyment even in life’s storms. Just do it, I <em>dare</em> you.</p>

          <h2><a href="/surrender-is-stronger/">surrender is stronger</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>Yes, the title is a contradiction, and yes, it is stolen from a song that is my new favorite “Undone” by FFH. I feel the title, largely appropriate given how I see this post beginning. Allow me to illuminate.</p>

<p>I’ve had a lot of time to think over the past few weeks between road trips, sleepless nights and random moments alone during the holidays. Therefore, it would only be fitting that I in my over-thinking nature would stumble upon some nugget of self-discovery. At the ripe old age of 23 (please note the intended sarcasm), I still have no clue who I am. Despite hours of counseling sessions in years prior, a few long conversations and many introspective forays, I am left in the dark on several crucial aspects of who I am. Now, I should clarify that I was not the one to point out this misconception, but God did give me the grace to understand the gravity of my brother’s statement the moment it left his mouth.</p>

<p>I have been told since I can remember that I am a quiet, patient and calm boy. To a degree, this is true, however underneath that, I at my very core am an oxymoron, a contradiction to my exterior. I am a quietly intense, passive aggressive person. Yes, on the surface I am rather calm, cool and collected, but underneath that, I am an excitable and ridiculous powder keg of a person.</p>

<p>Honestly, this explains a lot of the past 5 years. One-on-one, I am a person seeking deep conversation, meaning and a sincere understanding of the person on the other end of the dialogue. Alone, life must abide by the principle that everything carries with it a deeper meaning. In groups, I am an entertainer, typically relying on sarcasm and/or deadpanning which can leave me grossly misunderstood. I have to admit, often this is just my aim. I can also come off as horribly insincere given the right conditions. This persona clashes with the intrinsic need for depth of relationship and I have often been disappointed by people turned off to my more ridiculous crowd-induced persona.</p>

<p>What on earth does this have to do with anything? No, it is not my intent to blabber on about my personal life, as I don’t find that important, I assure you. I delve into the realm of vulnerability to encourage the reader down the path of self-discovery. I cannot tell you how many people I have seen finally tread this daunting path at the age of 40 or later, wishing they hadn’t waited so long. Yes, it’s a terrifying journey and it will only continue to be. The heart is a dark, dark place, but what do we have to lose? There is a lot that I would give up if only to understand myself. I think the value of being honest with yourself is infinite. If I cannot be honest with myself, then what hope do I have of being honest with another, especially the God I claim to love?</p>

<p>I think the person who has no sense of self is one of the few truly poor people in this world. I do not advocate a selfishness of thought or a complete inward focus, because that is foolish pride. However, I do wish to echo 1 Peter 1:5–8, where both virtue and knowledge are included in this list. We should supplement our faith with these two, where I don’t see any way of implementing virtue without introspection, and knowledge cannot be gained unless we understand what we do not know, thus also requiring introspection. If we do not know what within us is true, then we have no place to start. So, I am arguing here that a sense of self begins with an honesty within one’s soul. Without honesty, man is a piece of driftwood lost at sea.</p>

<p>The year is young. I think for many 2010 was a tough year, so why not begin <em>this</em> year down the fulfilling path toward discovery that can bring us closer to God? I mean, it’s just a thought…</p>

          <h2><a href="/reliants/">reliants</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>I can’t help but think that I’ve already blogged on this topic recently, but seeing as I haven’t (upon a cursory review) in the last month, I will continue this post. Seeing as I’ve spent the past few weeks surviving on an average of 5 hours of sleep, it’s only appropriate that God would be impressing upon me the need to look at reliance. Looking back on the past month and a half at this point, life has been eventful and somewhat tumultuous. There has been some notable trial in this period and I can’t help but feel that all the while, He has been whispering in my ear, “Turn to Me. Let Me show you peace and give you rest.”</p>

<p>Matthew 11:28 has come up a lot in this time, but I want to also look at verse 29. Together (in the ESV) they read, “Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.” There’s a lot to unpack in this statement, but I’ll try to maintain focus here.</p>

<p>I’m sorry, but what on earth does Jesus mean here? There are a million different ways you could and people have taken this passage. Honestly, I know I have much to learn about this, but I’ll try to step through explaining my current understanding.</p>

<p>Some translations substitute “burdened” for “heavy laden” which I understand a little better. I think He is speaking not of physical labor, because the following “burdened” which can mean “loaded oppressively” would apply only to a smaller subset of people who were treated unfairly by a boss or master. This simply does not seem in step with the rest of Christ’s ministry.</p>

<p>“…I will give you rest.” This piece makes little sense based on my experiences up to this point. Some of the times when I have felt closest to God have coincided with times of monumental exhaustion. If you question this, please feel free to ask my friends with whom I spent 10 weeks in Yellowstone.</p>

<p>I have to say, this next line is a little scary from my perspective, “Take my yoke upon you…” So, I’m sure you will remember that Jesus was <em>crucified</em>. Is this the “yoke” we are to take? I feel pretty certain that the yoke to which He refers is a labor of love. Yes, this life is meant to take work and effort, but He will never <em>burden</em> us. The first thing that this brings to mind is John 16:33. Christ said it Himself, we’ll have trouble and trials, but there is no oppression, because the weight is really on Him and He overcame that obstacle through His death and resurrection.</p>

<p>“…learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart…” Hmm, this sounds a little odd to say the least. I understand to a degree that Jesus was gentle, but what about flipping over tables in the temple? I doubt that qualifies as gentle by anyone’s standards. However, I think this statement has far greater implications than just Christ’s actions. I think that by this, He is asserting that He will never burden (there’s that word once again) those who come to Him. We see Him in John 10:11 saying, “I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.” Jesus is gentle in that He is not self-seeking. Lowly in heart, though?! Sure Christ wept and was rather somber at times, but what are we to make of this statement? I think this has to go hand in hand with Christ’s gentle nature. He willingly gave up His life on the cross so that we might have life. He took our burden (just seems appropriate once again) lifting our own loads and selflessly took it to the cross. Christ is lowly in heart as He thought Himself no greater than anyone else, let alone (despite His role in the Trinity) equality with God the Father (Mark 10:18).</p>

<p>“…you will find rest for your souls.” seems to reinforce that the focus of this passage is spiritual rather than physical. However, what does rest for one’s soul look or feel like? There are a lot of times that I feel very restless (like, right now for instance). What does this mean for us? I go to Psalm 116, where I think rest refers to a ceasing in the search for a fulfillment of the needs of our soul. I feel most would agree that our souls do have very real needs and the soul searches for what can provide for them. “ Return, O my soul, to your rest; for the LORD has dealt bountifully with you.” (Psalm 116:7) I believe illustrates that God not only provides for those needs, but does so abundantly (or bountifully in this translation).</p>

<p>How can I trust in this, though? Isaiah 40:28 assures, “Do you not know? Have you not heard? The LORD is the everlasting God, the Creator of the ends of the earth. He will not grow tired or weary, and his understanding no one can fathom.” Alright, so God will never take a break because He doesn’t need rest. Tozer, in Knowledge of the Holy, points out that God in His perfection cannot learn, nor can He change. Conceptually, there are parts that make up the God I attempt to love, but God does not have any components, otherwise there would have to be one greater to put those together. God, being perfect, must have been perfect for eternity, otherwise, once again, there must be a greater, but I will for the sake of simplicity assume the reader agrees that God is the <em>one</em> and <em>only</em> true God.</p>

<p>My real stumbling block here is not God Himself necessarily and certainly not His ability, but His desire to do good and provide for me. Honestly, I turn a blind eye to His gentle nature. I feel I need to cling to Hebrews 6:13–20. Without going too much into this, God so desired to provide for Abraham, that He sealed His promise with an oath sworn on the greatest thing He could think of, <em>Himself</em>. This is kind of mind blowing right now, as I’m trying to cope with my inability to conceptualize infinitude. Anyway, if I accept any of God’s promises as passed down to me also, then I should recognize the fact that they were made with the holiest, most sacred oath there can ever be.</p>

<p>Today, I will rejoice in the everlasting rest of my soul that I have laboring under Christ. I must be under some form of authority, so I’ll choose the good and kind master who in Himself promises an easy yoke, a light burden, and rest. There is no greater promise that anyone can and will ever make. Yes, I’ll turn from my God many times before I go to meet Him, but every time I return to Him, I know exactly what to expect, a promise on which I can rely and find sustenance for these dry bones of mine.</p>

          <h2><a href="/my-own-personal-hell/">my own personal hell</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>What can the believer actively strive toward, yet at the same time must they also pray and wait upon in the same breath? The answer I have in mind is spiritual growth. I find it odd to be posting on such a topic, but I’m feeling prodded to do so, therefore I have caved. Growth is something so critical to the Christian life, however it seems one of the least understood in the general case. I’m not saying that I myself have understood this facet of life, but I certainly have some thoughts and an anecdote (surprise, surprise).</p>

<p>As I prepare to disappear from my friends through the New Year going home for Christmas and working the week after, I think it only fair and appropriate to give all fair warning of what will be occupying my time. A few days ago, during a markedly emotional quiet time with the Lord, I felt a strong urging to do the very thing which scares me most. I felt the need to face my demons. Honestly, I had no clue what I was agreeing to (and I still don’t exactly), but I knew that it was in my best interest. That’s the funny thing about growth. There are two things, actually. First, it is begun and completed by the Holy Spirit (Philippians 1:6). Second, it is rarely an enticing proposition, but deep down we know it will be good, however the definition of the “it” we are typically left without.</p>

<p>So, there I was sitting in my bedroom floor, raising my head and realizing I had no idea what I had just signed up for, nor what the next step was. Then it hit me. What is always the first step to seemingly every conundrum? <em>Prayer</em>. Right then and there was I granted an awesome and terrifying revelation. Growth was going to require me to do the very thing that I was certifiably scared of. He was requiring me to trust Him to delve into the very bowels of my soul.</p>

<p>Here’s the tricky part about living in the Spirit. Once we receive direction from Him, we must then be obeying and actively following. Yielding to the Spirit and asking for direction is a great beginning, but walking in the Spirit involves taking that first step. That’s why it’s called “walking.”</p>

<p>Here I am today. It feels like I’m beginning my trek, destination: my personal hell. I am intentionally diving into the darkest, most evil and Godless depths of my soul. When I arrive, I am to find everything <em>but</em> God. I will, at least on some level, confront exactly how evil I am as a descendant of Adam and <em>that</em>, what I will find there, is what scares me. The epitome of Godlessness, the very definition of hell and pure evil, is what I’m looking forward to on this journey…Freaking great!</p>

<p>What I needed to be reminded of most at this very moment is that I am not headed for my own personal hell, not even close. Really?! The very Spirit which prompted me to set on this journey will be with me every step of the way (John 14:16–18). This evil place is nothing more than just that as it will be Godless no longer.</p>

<p>I have a great promise in the Spirit. He does it on a regular basis and helps me in my pursuit of searching my heart (Psalm 7:9). When I feel faint, He will grant me the strength to press on if I ask for it (like Samson in Judges 14:6). When I lack the wisdom in my search, He will supply His own, God’s truth (John 16:13). Finally, He will continue the work of sanctification that has begun in me (2 Corinthians 3:18).</p>

<p>I have a long way to go on this journey, but I have been pointed right at the enemy and I have been given every tool and reason to succeed in that endeavor. Everything about it is God’s mission, I am only the wayward journeyer who has wandered into His path for my life. He has and is supplying <em>everything</em> else. I do not know where the path will lead, nor do I know the next step, but I know I am not undertaking this alone. Yes, I’m still apprehensive…and scared. Even still, I hear the faint voice of my Savior claiming already victory in this as He has claimed all my life up to this moment (John 16:33).</p>

          <h2><a href="/you-may-call-me-scrooge/">you may call me scrooge</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>I want to begin this post by warning you that I’m rather passionate about this topic. You might say I have an axe to grind on the subject. What subject? Well, as the title alludes, it has a little something to do with Christmas. Really, at this point, I find it more appropriate to refer to the holiday as Xmas. It has nothing more to do with the birth of the Savior Jesus <em>Christ</em> than does Flag Day. This is horribly depressing to me to the point that I really am finding it hard to get excited for a season that only seems to revolve around consumerism and self-absorption.</p>

<p>First of all, Jesus was born in the late summer/early fall time frame. If you recall, Joseph and Mary were in Bethlehem to be counted for the census, but those were taken right after the harvest. This makes sense as the only time the people as a whole had anything to spare to the crown was right after they had sold their crops. The only reason the holiday is celebrated on this day was to make it more palatable to fourth century pagans who celebrated the winter solstice with drinking, orgies, etc. This was just a way to draw some of them to a less abominable form of celebration at the same time.</p>

<p>I understand that Valentine’s Day is a holiday nearly invented by Hallmark, but how did Christmas get to be the day where consumerism is at its ugliest? Where down the line did we miss the point of this day? Jesus was given gold, frankincense and myrrh (all very valuable, yes) that each were an allegory for a different role of the Savior, the God-Man come to obey the very law that no mere man could ever conceive of doing. How did we go from this to buying countless meaningless gifts for those around us because of what our calendar says December 25 is?</p>

<p>I am not considering myself above reproach on this issue as I have to confront my own issues with consumerism and the idol worship that is beneath it. Regardless, I find it hard celebrating the holiday the way we do now and calling myself a Christian. Sure, some of us read the nativity story in the Bible during the season and sing spiritual Christmas carols, but what is the difference that I am looking to achieve from the very pagans the holiday was meant to attract 1800 years ago? I think of 1 Corinthians 13:3 where Paul wrote, “If I give away all I have, and if I deliver up my body to be burned, but have not love, I gain nothing.” Sure, some of us sacrifice and spend a lot of money so the recipients of our gifts appreciate them. Where is our value system?! Oh how far we have fallen.</p>

<p>Christmas is the birth of our Savior. It was the coming of the greatest gift the earth and mankind has ever and will ever receive. Immanuel, God <em>with</em> us, descended from His seat at the right hand of the Father, so that we would not all be condemned to eternal separation from the Giver of Life (i.e., <em>death</em>), but have life to the fullest!</p>

<p>Even on the surface, I feel it rather obvious that this holiday needs to be a time of rejoicing and praise for all the blessings that God has given and who He is. Going slightly deeper, I think this is a time where I should be praying to see the blessings which I take for granted. That means cherishing family, friends as well as trials and struggles. They are all gifts rained down from heaven to work for the benefit of those who He knew and continues with in relationship (Romans 8:28–29).</p>

<p>How can I do this when everywhere I look all I see is “buy, buy buy”? I think this question has to come down to what do <em>I</em> value most? If I value my time, then the greatest gift I can give to my loved ones is just that. God gave us His Son in the first Christmas, so why should I not give something of comparable value to show my own love? Let’s wash our hands and shake the dust from our feet of this poisonous consumerism.</p>

<p>As a necessary post-publishing note, I <em>love</em> Christmas. I love being with my family, the music, ornaments, lights, smells and all the tradition in which the holiday is steeped.</p>

          <h2><a href="/now-what-can-i-expect/">now what can i expect?</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>I feel the title for this post is rather self-explanatory. While racking my brains after my last post, this topic landed smack-dab in my lap. No need to divulge too much here, but it made for a rough week coming to a deeper understanding that my expectations don’t leave me much option but to be disappointed. And often. So I questioned why have expectations at all? If I should have expectations, what should I realistically be expecting?</p>

<p>It’s tough not going into details about the circumstances surrounding this post, but trust me when I say that I firmly believe they are of little consequence. What is of consequence is the feeling of not having those expectations met. I had been rather hopeful of what I <em>knew</em> was to come and when I found out last week that wouldn’t be happening, it was that much harder a fall. Yes, I felt a little bitter and indignant, but I soon began to ask at whom all my emotional fury was directed. I’m sure you’ve already seen this coming, but (surprise, surprise) I was once again pointing the finger at God. I even used the words, “ I feel like You’re the kid on the ant hill and I am the ant directly under the concentrated beam of sunlight from Your magnifying glass.” The fact that I felt so affected was somewhat extraordinary in and of itself, but that is a whole other conversation. Admittedly, Thanksgiving was an emotional week for me for various reasons, so I had little trouble for once pouring out my unfiltered response at God’s feet. No, it was not pretty, but there were no punches held in the wake of my shattered expectations.</p>

<p>As somewhat of a side note, there were some external factors that contributed to my response, but once again that is another conversation. I was left at this point to deal with the aftermath of my hope and follow my own advice.</p>

<p>Wouldn’t life be significantly more enjoyable if we didn’t have expectations, thus never being let down by their not being met? Yes, this is a question I asked once again, and honestly, I think this to be partially true. God knew this question would be asked and He made sure it was answered in Proverbs 23:18 in response to the desperation of the Jews, Surely there is a future, and your hope will not be cut off.” Then, God speaks to us in the quintessential verse of Christian hope Jeremiah 29:11 saying, “For I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord, plans for welfare and not for evil, to give you a future and a hope.” Notice the last word. God <em>wants</em> to give us a hope. I don’t know about you, but that sounds an awful lot like an expectation there. God sets our expectations for us. I qualify this hope at last with Proverbs 10:28 which says, “The hope of the righteous brings joy, but the expectation of the wicked will perish.” That’s all well and good, but what does that mean exactly?</p>

<p>The Bible throws out the word “wicked” and other synonyms a lot, but what does “the expectations of the wicked” mean here? This is a real question, because I know that God is good and just, so if my expectations are not being met, does that mean my expectations fall into this category by some means? I believe that Hebrews 4:12 sheds some light on this when it says, “For the word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing to the division of soul and of spirit, of joints and of marrow, and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart.” So, if I were to use God’s word as a litmus test of sorts for my expectations, would I really need to ask this question? If I fully trusted God’s word to be <em>the</em> Truth and God Himself to be who He says He is, I think the answer is unequivocally <em>no</em>. I would say that “the expectations of the wicked” can more tangibly be considered as any hope or expectation not inspired by or holding to God’s word and promises contained therein (sorry, I got really excited this word came to mind).</p>

<p>There are far too many promises that God makes in the Bible to list them all, but one that I was just reminded of is that which was made to Abraham (Abram at the time). Galatians 3:15–29 I think believe really exemplifies what I’m getting at here. The promise given way back in Genesis 12:7 to bless the man and his offspring was not nullified with the advent of the Law. The promise was not nullified with the crucifixion of Christ and the subsequent new covenant. The promise is still valid today! God’s promises are not constrained to any earthly conditions. Really, it would seem that God’s promises are absolute, not subject to anything but His infinite grace. If I take a look at all the factors and circumstances that arise over time, God has every right to renege at some point because a <em>lot</em> of people over the course of time have done a <em>lot</em> of stupid things. I don’t hold a candle to several of even these people, yet this passage assures even me. God’s promise is according to His will which both are constrained only by His infinite grace. Through Christ’s resurrection, we have been sealed in this eternal promise of God’s riches as our inheritance.</p>

<p>I don’t think it’s possible for us to rid ourselves of expectations. We’re human and having lost the intimacy once experienced in the garden, we will always expect and hope for greater than the reality of this world. However, we need to weigh these expectations with God’s word. Sure, He has good planned for us, but we can’t confuse that good with the temporal good or our happiness. God’s ultimate good is bringing Himself glory and, though I’m still coming to terms with this, that often means that He wants to grow us along the way toward achieving that. And I know we all can agree that it often involves temporary pain along the way (Hebrews 12:11).</p>

          <h2><a href="/amazing-grace-what-is-your-sound/">amazing grace, what is your sound?</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>It seems this week that I will draw on a Greek philosopher for the feel of this post. My question, one that is undeniably paramount in my heart is what does grace look like? In other words, <em>what is the essence of grace</em>? Anyone here having images of Socrates, yes, he is the one in particular I am drawing from in this question. When you get down to the heart of it, what does this five-letter logic bomb mean?</p>

<p>I will now play the part of the lawyer asked of the essence of piety and tell you what I know grace <em>not</em> to be. Grace, is not an attempt to <em>forget</em>. Grace does not simply <em>ignore</em> in some sort of <em>blissful ignorance</em>. We are humans, not doormats. Because the Bible encourages us to “turn the other cheek,” this does not mean we are to bow to all who wish ill on us and take it on as our calling to lead a <em>miserable</em> and <em>spineless</em> existence. Finally, grace is not <em>dependent upon change</em> in the wrongdoer. Grace is <em>not</em> conditional or with any strings attached or every Christian would be nothing more than Pinocchio. We cannot use it as a <em>powerplay</em> to force the sanctification unwillingly of the person in the wrong, because <em>none of us are God</em> therefore none of us can change anyone’s heart which is the only means by which repentance can be achieved. To all this, Socrates would reply, “You have told me what it is not, but what is it?” It is also not turning a blind eye toward wrongdoing and blindly move on. This is a sad state of disillusionment. Grace is not accepting all bad things as essentially good and without consequence and continuing once again in an ignorant stupor.</p>

<p>I will try harder, so that I might think of what grace really is in human terms. Grace is the <em>action</em> that accompanies a heart of <em>love</em>. It is the <em>accepting</em> of the consequences of another’s wrong and not holding onto the hurt, but <em>letting go</em> of the reaction fueled by hurt because of the recognition of God’s absolute sovereignty. Grace is love <em>unharmed</em> by an attack, with or without intention, on that love and the relationship attached to it. So let’s get straight what I have said above. Acknowledging the fact that God can do anything, let’s suppose that He can fill a heart, a human heart of flesh, with love. I am to assume that grace then is whenever love leads to any action such as a show of affection toward a loved one? While I may have asserted earlier that we are not doormats, it seems that we are compost piles with a heavenly farmer to cultivate. This seems like a miserable existence. Overall, grace seems to be turning a blind eye to actions against love of any kind that are merely accepted by the afflicted and pushed on like a plate of unwanted food under the table to the family dog played by God.</p>

<p>These may be possible objections to grace, but they are all rather far from the truth. It seems that I am not able to put grace and its essence into human words, possibly because there are none or maybe simply because I am incapable of eloquence here. Either way, I will try to explain through example. Grace is when our best friend on the earth does the one thing thought to be unforgivable, yet God opens your eyes to the many times He’s forgiven you and you in turn are able to come to that person and with a whole heart, forgive them as well. You acknowledge ad experience the hurt inside, yet you trust that God is working through the situation in all parties involved with the faith that it is all still in His good, perfect and pleasing plan and you turn around and work together with your friend to repair what was broken and strive side by side forward and upward. It is a stranger taking what is most valuable to you and when given the opportunity for retribution, relying on God’s justice in a higher court. Instead of earthly justice by a judge and jury, you seek forgiveness from the God of forgiveness and love the guilty party in the wake of destruction and brokenness.</p>

<p>Why grace, though? What is the motivation for this paradoxical act? Here is the crux of this entire post. Grace is 1 John 4:9–11 “In this the love of God was made manifest among us, that God sent his only Son into the world, so that we might live through him. In this is love, not that we have loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins. Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another.” It is because while we were mired in death under the Law, Christ came and gave us life. It is Romans 5 and 6. Grace is freedom from death that is the only penalty of sin. It is the restoration of the dead. It is the light in the dark. Grace is salvation only made possible through the love of a God whose love is infinite. Grace is the ultimate sacrifice that is the only vehicle most capable of achieving the highest purpose in this universe. Grace is the magnification of God’s glory in the most unlikely of circumstances. Drawing from a mentor and coworker, grace is the infusion of life into what for all intents and purposes is dead and lifeless.</p>

          <h2><a href="/the-other-pornography/">the other pornography</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>I don’t think too many people will argue that pornography poses a significant threat to our society and the institution of marriage. What I feel gets overlooked is the pornography directed toward our hearts and emotions. This more covert brand targets our perception of love and romance, creating a potentially damaging unrealistic ideal of what they should look like. They raise our expectations to a level that no human being, no demigod or demigoddess could ever meet. I would argue that this is just as much an issue as its visual counterpart as it is not as gender specific.<br />
In all honesty, the topic for this post came to me from watching Megamind last night. I don’t know why this particular movie brought it to the forefront of my attention, but I couldn’t help notice the theme of fighting for the girl that pervades the plot. The fight for the affections of Roxanne is <em>the</em> driving factor for the plot in the last at least third of the movie. This got me to wondering what my perception of romance really is. I’m bombarded daily with fairy tale situations and ideals that romance and love should be this, that or the other airbrushed concept, but where do I find my heart in the midst of this full-frontal assault?<br />
Admittedly, I’ve watched more than my fair share of chick-flicks as a guy. Even more embarrassingly, I own a few as well. I’ve chosen to see several movies where a fantasized version of love and romance is the <em>only</em> semblance of a plot. I’m pretty sure at this point, I could write my own screenplay and it would at least be passable in the genre. So what? The problem I recognize in my own heart is that I’ve become so used to these ideals that I often forget that like Santa Claus, the Tooth Fairy and the Easter Bunny, <em>Prince Charming is DEAD</em>.<br />
I realize that may have been a little harsh, but please bear with me. OK, so Prince Charming was never a real person to begin with, but my heart does not want to accept that as truth. It took a very rough breakup to even begin to scratch the surface of this struggle and another few years to revisit the unhealed wound in my soul. I cannot be the perfect guy. Sorry, self, I’m not Christ either. I’d love to be able to walk on water and provide my princess with the fairy tale ending, but I’m no prince, no white knight. Only painfully and grudgingly am I confronting this now.<br />
What is scary is as I peek my head above the comfortable foxhole I’ve buried myself in for the past few years, I see that this poison has permeated media as I know it. <em>It’s everywhere</em>. The iTunes top ten chart, the movies, TV shows, you name it and it’s been overtaken by perverted version of romance. A movie directly marketed toward kids (though riddled with references from the 80s and 90s) rife with the stuff. What are we feeding our children? What am I feeding myself?! (In case you didn’t catch on yet, no, I don’t have a wife or kids). I’m sorry, but is it really so alarming that the institution of marriage isn’t doing too well?<br />
I’m not making light of the situation, in fact I mean to cast a little more light in the direction of this catastrophe we are watching. While the bigger problem is the divorce rate as a whole, I think the deeper issue here is what the effect this emotional pornography is having on that divorce rate. How many marriages fail because “it just didn’t work out”? Now, I don’t have the statistics nor the experience to tell you that I <em>know</em> what that means, but I certainly have my suspicions. Having seen a divorce, albeit rather amicable one, I have a vague idea of the beast. I feel many couples ignore the “signs” because another part of their fantasy is being fulfilled. Perhaps a few couples have hit the rocks because one or both is no longer feeling the “spark” that they once felt. The relationship isn’t as magical as it once was. Someone just got bored. It seems that we have gone astray in this area as well (Isaiah 53:6).<br />
I know many have memorized this, but somewhere along the way, our society has trampled its meaning and value into the mud of pop-culture. 1 Corinthians 13:4–8a states, “Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. <em>Love never ends</em>.” What about “never” are we not getting here? And where is there room for love not being enough? If love bears and endures all things, then for what is it insufficient? On the other side of the coin, if couples are not willing to live by this in their marriage, then they’re not getting married for the right reasons to begin with. If we are not ready to commit to a life of labor, next to the one whom we <em>love</em>, then is married life really life at all?<br />
I have been bought with a price, so why do I subject myself to emotional slavery (1 Cor. 7:23)? Even a cursory glance over 1 Corinthians 7 speaks volumes about what marriage is, and it looks <em>nothing</em> like Hollywood’s farce with which I am most familiar. You can read it yourself, so I won’t belabor the point. Let’s make love risky, gritty, messy, sloppy, but real, visceral and rewarding. Let’s enjoy it for both its joys and trials and thank God that it has both, so that the joys are that much more valuable to us.</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p>There’s a problem I see in my life that I feel contributes to the stagnation of many Christians’ lives. This in turn poisons the Church and leaves us, well…where we are now in a large part. The problem is that I know I am great many times at recognizing when I have slipped back into the all too comfortable ways of rebellion against God. However, I then refuse to take the next step. Instead, I wallow in my own self-deprecation and filth until God picks me up out of my mire and cleans the muck off me once more. This doesn’t seem like a great way to endure life, and it’s not what God has planned for mine.</p>

<p>Even before Christ’s assurance of salvation through His death on the cross and resurrection, God desired to cleanse His people. In Isaiah 1:18, to a wayward people who had broken their covenant with Him for umpteenth time, God says, “Come now, let us reason together, says the LORD:though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red like crimson, they shall become like wool.” God even then wanted us desperately not to be separated from Him for any reason. In light of Calvary, how unforgivable can our sins be now? The work has been done, our sins paid for two milennia ago. Saint, you have been set free for freedom’s sake! Let us not pretend that the price Christ paid at the cross was not enough! Let us not act as if sin is our master still!</p>

<p>I see room for skepticism, so allow me to illustrate and please forgive in advance my honesty. I could show you multiple examples throughout the Bible of screwups whom God gave integral roles in bringing glory to Himself, but instead I will give you a few personal examples which feel more appropriate in this setting.</p>

<p>My parents separated while I was in high school, and being a high schooler, I did what came naturally which was to run from my problems. Yes, there were many deep-seated problems, but all I knew at that point was to run. I ran from them, my parents, my family, but most importantly God. In retrospect, that’s the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard of seeing as He’s <em>infinite</em>! I ran straight into alcohol and marijuana, basically the party scene. To clarify, we’re not talking about needing to go to AA meetings or rehab, but it was a real problem in my life at this point. There were many blackout nights and waking up wondering where I’d ended up from the night before, yet there is a bone rattling realization I had to come to. God had already forgiven me for all this. I just needed to come to Him and accept this gift. No gimmicks, no strings attached.</p>

<p>I have sought acceptance all my life, certainly all of it that I can recall. Right around the time of high school, this seeking took the form of getting into dating and random hook-ups (fitting right in with the partying I already mentioned). I’ve spent the past six years dealing with this. Between the couple miserably failed relationships, the drunken hook-ups and the other random stupidity I found myself getting into in this realm, I became an empty shell at one point in particular. Acceptance, unwavering acceptance, is only found in God I’m just now coming to fully grasp. Seeking to find it anywhere else is just…sinful. Once again, enter God and his reassuring call that I am still forgiven.</p>

<p>Finally, I may say that I haven’t murdered, but Matthew 5:21 clearly states that even the thought of malice or hatred carries the same weight of murder. Therefore, I think that suicidal thoughts also would be counted in this category. It’s not something I’m proud of, none of these sins are, but God has used this as well for good. I reached my lowest point after being dumped by my girlfriend of nearly 2 1/2 years and seeing every hope I had left of a “happy” existence flushed down life’s drain. I had no “perfect” family, I was not doing well in school and now I had the girl who I actually thought I was going to marry, have 2 kids with and the house with the picket fence ripped right out of my life. What more did I have to live for? Yes, I went there. Even in this time, God showed me that my family did love me and would be devastated by my absence and <em>that’s</em> what saved my life. And still, God assured me there was nothing I could do to overcome or invalidate His love.</p>

<p>So great. I’m forgiven. Whoop-de-do. Here’s possibly the biggest part of this process. Next, comes the heart transplant. “Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come.” (2 Corinthians 5:17) What this means in this case is that we are not subject to sin’s tyranny over our lives and we are able to <em>repent</em> or to (in the literal) turn from. This is a gift from God, because as I’m sure your experiences have told you, sin is more powerful than man. This is why it is so easy to succumb to. There is no 5 step process here, but I bring back the word <em>community</em>. We in this setting must seek to find the root of our sin which usually is easier for uninvolved parties as they have the luxury of being more objective and therefore insightful. Community also helps with the other components of this step which are prayer and a steeping in God’s word. Psalm 119:11 illustrates the purpose of memorizing Scripture particularly in this context, “I have stored up your word in my heart, that I might not sin against you.” The need for prayer here is because of what is said in James 1:5–6, “If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask God, who gives generously to all without reproach, and it will be given him. But let him ask in faith, with no doubting, for the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea that is driven and tossed by the wind.” As a side note, pay specific attention to the “with no doubting” part. When we seek wisdom, God’s wisdom, we should have every assurance that <em>He will provide</em>. “Or which one of you, if his son asks him for bread, will give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a serpent? If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him!” (Matthew 7:9–11). When we ask for a changed heart, we should fully expect it. Just remember that we are expecting it at <em>God’s</em> pace and in <em>His</em> time, not ours.</p>

<p>In summary, despite my chronic affinity for rebellion, Christ’s work on the cross was in fact complete as Jesus Himself attested to in John 19:30, so our sin (<em>all</em> of it) was forgiven at that very moment, and now because of that victory we are called to repentance to continue the striving toward sanctification which is the calling of God’s chosen ones. Happy, it will not be, but glorious is the reward. Do not be fooled, the God of all the universe would never reward His followers with anything less than abundant wealth and joy that cannot be measured by earthly standards!</p>

          <h2><a href="/prayer-artificial-shroud-of-my-soul/">prayer: artificial shroud of my soul</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>Once again, friends, I find myself in the uncomfortable position of feeling drawn to write about a subject on which I am by no means an expert. Enter grace, both from above and hopefully from the reader haha. The topic I am referring to is prayer. I am not a “prayer warrior” by any standards. My prayer life for as long as I have considered myself to be a “Christian” has resembled the dialogue of a silent film. Save the typed interjections that are a little more than forced in many cases, there really hasn’t been any dialogue. It is something that has come up in the past, but this time I really felt a kick in the pants to pursue more faithfulness in this area. Therefore, I started reading “(Re)Understanding Prayer” by Kyle Lake…and can’t put it down (a true statement for a bibliophobe such as myself).</p>

<p>The first of the proverbial walls to fall in on my fragile construct of prayer had to be my definition of prayer. What on earth is prayer? Really? It is <em>not</em> (I feel I should capitalize and highlight all this for my own benefit) reading from a script even if designated solely for God. Prayer is the bearing of our naked and unashamed souls before our Creator and Savior. It is the recognition that only through Christ’s sacrifice on the cross and His raising from the dead that we have an intercessor (John 14:6). We have His imputed righteousness through His serving as propitiation for our transgressions against God (1 John 4:9–10). We have <em>no</em> reason to approach the throne with timidity (Hebrews 4:16). Our God literally died in order that He could get to know us and us Him. Wow, this statement just hit me. We should speak to God the way we spoke to our parents when we were children; without a filter of any sorts. Prayer is raw, unfiltered, visceral. Prayer is an <em>honest conversation</em> between our Father and us, His children.</p>

<p>Another of my shortcomings in the area of prayer is my frequency. So, how often should I pray? Prayer should be every second of every minute of every day. If I am reading Romans 12:1 correctly, then presenting my body is a constant imperative that is continual and including of <em>everything</em> of my being. Prayer in light of this should be unceasing. Prayer should not be an interval of time that merely denotes how holy I am to consider myself (the longer the better), but a constant lifting of my broken heart up to the Holy of Holies.</p>

<p>Finally, prayer is not just a head bowed, eyes closed and hands together activity. If life is prayer, then engaging in community and our passions is also prayer. Prayer in its purest definition is engaging in whatever God has granted to bring us joy. If you’re a musician, then playing music is prayer just as much as the formal prayer at bedtime.</p>

<p>Now you know this wasn’t nearly as planned as I will throw in some actual last remarks here. Can we also ditch the canned phrases I know I am guilty as can be for using? God is always with everyone, so what do I really mean by “God, be with (person)”? And the word “bless” is so vague that “God, bless (so and so)” could mean any one of a million different things. What do I really want God to do for so and so? I need to just <em>say</em> it.</p>

<p>As a final benediction of sorts, Father, help me, help us, to come to you wholly and explicitly to enjoy our relationship the way You intended it to be, without shrouds or secrecy. Grant me understanding of what a life of prayer looks like practically and give me the desire to strive toward that with everything in my being. Thank you for listening to the words of this mess of a man claiming to live for You. Amen.</p>

          <h2><a href="/pain-in-the-offering/">pain in the offering</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>“If God is good, then why does He allow pain and suffering?” A great question I have heard a few times. A new friend mentioned within the last week that he had gotten that question many times and it got me thinking. How would I answer that question? It is truly a great question, and something that I haven’t really thought about for a long time.</p>

<p>Pain, suffering to be more specific, I firmly believe is a result of the fall of Adam and Eve. It would be inconceivable to think that God intended originally for there to be suffering inflicted on His most dear creations. I think a majority of people can agree that this world is fallen and broken at least in a way or two. Paul noted this in Romans 8:22 when he said, “For we know that the whole creation has been groaning together in the pains of childbirth until now.” It could only be groaning if it were impatiently waiting for something better; something better and worth desiring.</p>

<p>I cannot broach this topic without thinking of a favorite song of mine written by a friend. “I’d Sing Hallelujah” by Andy Zipf really serves to embody a person wrestling with the issue of pain. “…I am not Lewis or Clark; I am only a man that gets lost in his questions like, ‘Why doesn’t love heal when we need it most?’ Will somebody give me the answer I need?” Before I get in over my head, I think it’s relevant to note a strong belief of mine. I do not consider my spiritual journey active unless it is being challenged and reshaped. I am whelmingly finite in my ability and only over time will God slowly reveal His truth more fully. I believe this process is necessary given the infinite nature of God and how it speaks even more to how awesome He is being able to work through my ineptitude.</p>

<p>I have read C.S. Lewis’ The Problem of Pain and I believe he explains the need for pain in our world. Lewis describes pain as a megaphone in our lives used when God wants to grab our full attention. I have noticed that when I am in agony, I am much more apt to throw myself at the foot of the cross. Too many times for my liking has God used pain in my life to wake me from a complacent sleep to rouse me back to life in my relationship with Him. In a world that is moving so fast that it makes my head spin thinking about it, pain is the mechanism that God uses to slow down our world for us.</p>

<p>Frankly, this still leaves us up a creek. What does this mean for me when I am in the midst of my darkest time? So I run to God, but where is His provision? I believe He would say it is in community. Certainly, God will use His Spirit to comfort us, but more often than not, God will lead us toward fellowship with others. Fellowship is not a luxury item in this life. It is an essential and central component of the Church. Fellowship is the only way man can truly thrive and flourish. Times of struggle are no different for us. God uses the people around us and typically closest to us to point us back in the right direction; back towards God. This is just another example of how awesome God is.</p>

<p>Pain, deep pain that can often cause bitterness, is integral to our existence of constant tension on this earth. We groan inwardly with creation for a new and perfect earth and heaven, but for now we obediently wait. God has a much grander plan in which He uses a base element such as pain to right our waywardness and point us back toward His goodness. Yes, even pain is a gift in this life. Pain is another way God shows us how much He loves us. Maybe this doesn’t make sense, but pain as with everything else in this life is nothing short of a gift from our benevolent, gracious Creator. Consider it all joy, brothers, when you face trials, because they are not punishment, but gifts whose beauty you will marvel at soon enough.</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p>I don’t know when the big switch was flicked, but there’s been a significant shift in our culture that I know I suffer from immensely. For a long time, it seems Christian men held onto the image of the ideal man being…well, a macho and domineering tyrant reigning freely over his family. At some point, there was a violent shift in the opposite direction and the dominant paradigm has seen men relegate themselves to passive nincompoops in far too many cases.</p>

<p>If we are looking to throw stones, I could be counted among the first in the receiving line.</p>

<p>There are the competing ideologies it appears between men being the head of the household just as Christ is head of the Church (Ephesians 5:23) as well as the call to be meek (Colossians 3:12). Are these really competing ideas? Well, categorically, NO. What I feel is the true issue is that we have once again decided that one piece of the puzzle is more important than another. But, what are these pieces, really?</p>

<p>My default interpretation of Paul here in Ephesians seems highly misguided. What is this “head”? This head I am coming to realize is love. If husbands are to imitates Christ’s role over the Church, then we men must seek to imitate this role as fully as possible. This includes love, unconditional, guidance that is both gentle in the decision-making process and firm in holding to that decision. Also, this includes full responsibility for all decisions made. Sole accountability to both God and men rests squarely on our shoulders and we are called to accept all this with vigor and zeal.</p>

<p>Given that Colossians was also penned by Paul, it is hard to imagine a man would recklessly seek to undo his own work. I will skip to what I perceive to be the crux of my own misunderstanding and assume the rest of the passage to be somewhat self-explanatory. The word meek, has tripped me up for many years because I did not know what it meant. Meekness refers to submission and obedience. We are not being called to be human doormats waiting for God to move in some monumental way that jolts us into action. We are called back to the Garden. Paul is hearkening back to Adam and Eve before the fall, when their wills, though free, were in perfect accordance with God’s. Christ was holy, not because He was sinless. Yes, He was sinless, but He was sinless because He was meek and wholeheartedly obedient to the will of His (and our) Father. Thus, our obedience should be an active pursuit of God’s will, because Christ was never idle.</p>

<p>Both of these passages are competing? I think it is Paul issuing both sides of the same coin here. As it says in Psalm 37:4, “Delight yourselves in the Lord and He will give you the desires of your heart.” When we actively pursue this obedience and stand upright in our faith, we find ourselves steeped in the desire to bring God glory and because this is His ultimate purpose, He will never fail to continue to bring this to fruition. When we as men strive after a steadfast meekness rooted in the words and will of God, He will not allow us to be shaken and only then can we be considered men at all.</p>

          <h2><a href="/the-other-25/">the other 25</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>For the sake of argument, let’s assume there are 4 Sundays in a month and you attend church each of those Sundays and then you also attend the church’s monthly outreach event. Let’s also for the sake of argument say there are 30 days in a month. This leaves 25 days throughout each month where your faith is not thrust into the forefront of your attention. Needless to say, more often than not, we are in situations where there is nothing else helping to ensure your faith is your first love and focus.</p>

<p>If you’re at all like me, this does not translate rather well. I’d say on average, I have a real conversation regarding my faith on five different days out of the remaining 25. So, on a good month, I have lived but a third of them in a manner remotely hearkening back to the calling I have as a Christian and a light in the darkness of this world. There are many things you could say to this, but short of shouting expletives, this should be absolutely inadmissible even to the youngest of believers.</p>

<p>We now clearly have a problem. Sure, I know myself to not be your poster-boy Christian, but I know I’m not the only one here. I say there is a problem, but what really <em>is</em> the problem? The problem is simply the fact that my faith is largely a role I play or an article of clothing I put on. It’s like that ugly Christmas sweater you’re aunt that you see once a year gave you years ago and the only time you pull it out is when all of your friends are wearing their similar sweaters all to the same Tacky Christmas Sweater Party. Safety in numbers, right? True, but NO! There are a few things that come to mind right now, but safety sure as the air I’m breathing right now <em>isn’t</em>.</p>

<p>Where do I, where do <em>we</em>, go from here? In some ways we must ascend and in others, descend. Allow me to explain my contradiction. We ascend in the sense that we must elevate our focus on something greater than our own underwhelming glory. I think that my focus, the fact that I am so self-consumed, is the biggest problem here. Yes, it boils down to a pride issue. Any focus that belongs to God, but is redirected back toward ourselves is in fact pride. What am I really striving toward? The living, breathing heart that I was given by my Creator, I misuse for the purpose of worshiping myself and other things beneath the capacity of this beautiful entity. At this moment, I am reminded of the quote, “Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure.” I feel this is certainly applicable here.</p>

<p>We must also descend. We must climb down from the shoddy throne we have built for ourselves and make room for the King who rightfully deserves to reign in the kingdom of our hearts. He purchased it with His own blood and sacrifice, yet I know I oft ignore this crucial piece of the picture and seek to be a tyrant over my own life. We all must serve some master in this life, it is how we were created. Why not choose the most merciful and only good master there is? There are many excuses I have made, but none of them good, so what’s yours?</p>

<p>At the risk of running long, I have a tale of God’s sovereignty even in apathetic rebellion. Last weekend, I skipped a Bible study because I was too tired and then our outreach day at church to get a needed oil change. I decided to sit outside at a table at Starbucks up the street, where two friends participating in the evangelical outreach with our church spotted me and asked me if I wanted to pray with them about a conversation they had just had with a man. While we were praying together, a man without full mental faculties came up to us and asked us where a certain record store was, but none of us had heard of it, so we all dismissed the man. As he walked away, so did our spirits. We all felt an overwhelming pull to converse with this man, but we let him walk away. We finished praying, and my friends, rather subdued, left and I went back to my own work.</p>

<p>I know God is greater than apathy, however, the man then proceeded to walk by another 3 times! Needless to say, I was very aware of my own inaction, but refused to overcome the friction keeping me in my own little world. Over the corner of my screen, I see a figure sitting down at the opposite side of the table. It was <em>this</em> man! Incredulously, I recognized what was happening. We had a two-hour conversation that ended with a slice of pizza (for him, not me given my several food intolerances) and a burning in my soul.</p>

<p>Where is the relevancy in this story? One, it goes to show that I am not advocating some sort of performance-based religiousness. Two, God even when I am trying my hardest to be apathetic is far more capable of carrying out His will than I give Him credit for. Three, what I alluded to as the burning in my soul is what I believe to be a small example of God providing a change of heart in this area. Very tangibly after this conversation, I felt like someone had punched me in the heart as I desperately longed for this man to know the One who I call “Savior”.</p>

<p>While first needing to recognize the fact that God does not need me, I understand that God also does not need me to get in His way. The best thing I can do, is seek to walk in His will during those other 25 days. When an opportunity is granted, as a faithful God will assuredly do in response to diligent prayer, it behooves me to make the most of it, boldly proclaiming what I know and live to be true. This proclamation takes a few different forms, but apathy and cowering are not counted among them. I think the best way to spend the other 25 is to faithfully pray that God would change our hearts so they have the same focus as the 5.</p>

          <h2><a href="/dating-in-the-flesh/">dating in the flesh</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>I come into this week’s post a bit torn. I want badly to post, but the topic is something that I do not feel terribly qualified to broach. This week finds me weighing in on dating and most likely offering my jaded and misguided view on the practice.</p>

<p>I will admit that, unlike the people who have followed Josh Harris’ advice to a ‘t’, I think dating a healthy practice today. Maybe a few hundred years ago when marriages were commonly arranged, courtship was the norm, but I feel this is because love was not a prerequisite for matrimony. The concerned man and woman (girl in a lot of cases) underwent this process, because they were <em>going</em> to get married whether they liked it or not, so they first needed to get to meet one another and then run the entire course of a relationship before concluding in marriage. Lord, thank You that this is no longer the practice. I’m sorry, but that seems atrocious. From experience, relationships today aren’t nearly as forced. The only people I would even consider dating are people who I already knew and was familiar with. I feel like this initial getting to know step is the major game changer here. Without that step being planned, really is courtship <em>that</em> different from dating?</p>

<p>Yes, I consider myself inexperienced in the field as I’ve had two real dating relationships to note and another relationship that almost disastrously resulted in dating. Honestly, I probably learned about as much from the relationship that wasn’t as I did from the other two, but that’s a horse of a different color.</p>

<p>So, what is the purpose of dating? This is my question, honestly. Is it marriage? I think this is the folly of the Church and all us young folk running around blindly seeing only the happily married around us, thinking that is the ultimate crown of achievement on this earth for us. <em>It’s not!</em> This I am certain of. Marriage is the <em>ultimate</em> purpose, but I feel there is another along the way that is highly important. I think that purpose is to experience Christ in a whole new way that involves both personal and interpersonal discovery. Through the dating ritual, if you will, we come to understand ourselves in the context of a closer relationship with someone of the opposite sex. We see how we were made to interact and how we thrive in relationship. We also come to see Christ in a different light that is not as accessible by other means.</p>

<p>I think there’s a significant reason why Paul only distinguished between married and single. Dating does not mean that you are wrapped up in your significant other. Dating is more like a tourist visa to a foreign place than it is a black hole. I have made the mistake of focusing on preparing myself for a life with the person I was dating, because I saw dating as the transitional stage between single and married. When dating, we are still single, because I think that Paul was referring to our heart condition. We are single as in our heart consists of only our singular soul which is dedicated solely to God. When married, our heart consists of the grafted hearts of both partners whose dedications are both to God and to one another.</p>

<p>Finally, the hardest question: what should dating look like? I could write a novel on what dating <em>shouldn’t</em> look like, but I do have some thoughts here. First of all, the first date should be nothing more than an appointment or a meeting. It should not be the potential beginning of the rest of your life as this gets back again to the purpose of dating. Second of all, dating should be focused on both people growing <em>simultaneously</em>. Both should desire to grow first and foremost in their relationship with Christ, not with each other. I think each person needs the room to grow alongside one another without the squelching pressure of trying to forcefully grow together as one. I think I would prefer to leave that to pre-marital counseling and marriage itself.</p>

<p>Dating has long been kryptonite in my life as I’ve had zero clue how to go about them. Honestly, I have little clue now, but Christ has been gracious enough to show me how to have my heart broken and then come back to have it happen again. Dating, like everything else in this life, is made to be another way to worship our great God, but somewhere along the line I’ve missed that memo. I’ve committed every faux pas I’ve mentioned above as well as many others and in only a couple chances haha. I know I’m not the only one making these mistakes, but for once I want to take my own advice as well as the advice of some wise people who have mercifully been placed in my life. Long story short, dating doesn’t have to resemble a minefield. It can be a much calmer place with less pressure and tension if we only sought to go about it in a more Godly way.</p>

          <h2><a href="/an-epiphany-of-hope-to-a-chronic-hellion/">an epiphany of hope to a chronic hellion</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>Driving from the gym in the drizzle and the euphoric post-workout high, I was granted an epiphany. Why are we so downtrodden and haggard all the time? We as Christians have been given so much, yet we appreciate it all so little!</p>

<p>A verse that has been on my heart lately has been 1 Corinthians 4:7, which says “What do you have that you did not receive? If then you received it, why do you boast as if you did not receive it?” Now, I realize this does not perfectly tie in to what I posed as question earlier, but allow me to explain myself. First of all, we’ve been given everything we have in this life, so the burden is not ours to provide for our own needs. I think this speaks to God’s omniscience as He knows all our needs even before we speak them to Him. This also speaks to His willingness to do good for us.</p>

<p>This last assertion clashes violently with the broken and tarnished image I have of my Maker. Through the Ten Commandments and the life of Christ, we have every example of who God is, yet I choose to adamantly disbelieve Him at His word. What I have described is subversion and rebellion. Now that I have revealed a bit of my inner-hellion, I resume my original and intended train of thought.</p>

<p>Once we have come to recognize that our provision is God’s, a joyful task that He carries out for His children <em>without fail</em>, we then encounter another quote from Paul in Philippians 4:13 where He asserts the old adage “I can do all things through Him who strengthens me.” I think there is a significant implication that I overlook from the interplay of these two verses. Not only does God willingly provide all that we have, but in such a way that we are capable of doing <em>anything</em> when we follow His will. I could go into a tirade to the key of John Piper here, but I don’t have <em>Don’t Waste Your Life</em> with me, nor do I have the patience to see where that would lead. To quote <em>Anchorman</em> A-NY-THIN-G! Through Christ, God has granted us the ability to carry out His will no matter the task, regardless of the circumstances.</p>

<p>I see the dreariness of the day and this seems far-fetched and hopelessly optimistic religious rhetoric. At the heart level, all that is within me screams out with vocal chords on the brink of tearing, acknowledging and longing for this fulfillment. Faith is not a feeling, but I feel, I sense, I perceive (what have you), that this cannot be a lie. God has so much more in store for my life. He has so much greater planned for <em>our</em> relationship, yet I am content playing in my tiny, grungy sandbox. Wake, o you sleeper!</p>

<p>I have now reached a fever pitch within me. I wasn’t sure I was going here, but I cannot help but culminating this with the victory that we see through all of this. John 16:33 illustrates through Christ’s own words the victory and assurance we have in all of this. In our weakness, doubt and rebellion, Christ proclaims to the disciples, “I have told you these things so that in me you may find peace. You will face trouble in this world but take heart, for I have overcome the world.” I don’t know about you, but this completely wrecks my worldview. We have the strength in Christ to do all things, because <em>it’s already been done</em>. Your cares, troubles, worries, burdens and afflictions all have been conquered at Calvary. All you who are bent, broken and weary, lift your eyes! We have a Savior who knows your pain and overcame it two millennia ago! All we need to do is come to Him and He will open our blurry eyes to the victory He accomplished on our behalf. He wants this desperately for us, yet He allows for our free will, so that it is our choice to come to Him. Though He is never far, in a sense, He in His infinite wisdom gives you a choice. What will I choose today? Will I choose to rejoice in my Savior and Sustenance, or will I simply wallow in my own miserable existence that is apart from Him? Gracious Father, may it be the former. Amen.</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p>It seems to be that time of the week again, and I’m trying to make this a regular event. I’m not sure what about this exactly, but it is such a release that I feel maybe in a sense I need to do this. Maybe it’s just how I express myself and I think that’s something we all need to do in one manner or another.</p>

<p>Touching on this idea of being the “new guy” again, I’ve found it easy to use that as an excuse to go into a shell of sorts. I don’t know any of these people well enough to be truly and genuinely open with my soul, so I retreat into the shell of sarcasm. It’s frighteningly easy to do. Several people have made comments about the amount of sarcasm I use in everyday conversation and I used those comments as fuel to own the sarcasm that replaced meaningful conversations and interactions that could have forced me to become more vulnerable with that person than I felt comfortable being in that moment. That’s a pathetic excuse, but it’s what I’ve been using for the better part of the time I’ve been here (OK, the entire time I’ve been here with the exception of a few weaker moments of truth haha). Why?</p>

<p>Isn’t the point of community and getting to know other people to become vulnerable with one another? Am I not/aren’t we all just dying to be known and to know others? Why then, do I seek so badly to retard this process? The fact is, relationships, like everyone’s story that I mentioned before, <em>are</em> messy! People experience pain, feelings get hurt and hearts get trampled. This sounds terrible, but in the end the overwhelming truth is that our hearts are kept intact throughout this apparent abuse. My heart over these few, albeit short, years on this earth has never actually been literally broken. God has always been there in my darkest hours of pain and suffering and held together my fragile heart. He has always comforted me when I needed it most and assured me that everything would be alright. Moreover, I have always been better for the wear. It almost seems like God uses heartache as a means of drawing us to Him and allowing Him to give us His best when He then has our full attention.</p>

<p>Heartache, like everything else in this world, can indeed be used by this amazing God for greater good. To me this is mind blowing and elementary at the same time. Honestly, the fact that God can use unpleasantry to achieve His purposes is both astonishing and just goes to show my very limited image of Him. The fact that He’s done this over and over in my life also makes it seem mundane and I take this fact for granted. How did I get to allowing this person or situation to affect me so deeply? It’s because I took the time to let myself be vulnerable and capable of being hurt by the circumstances. I had the faith to do so then, but how come I cannot muster it now? What has changed?</p>

<p>The only answer I have to all this is that I trust God less, obviously. Without relationships, real and ugly at times, I limit myself on how I experience God’s love and grace in my life. God very tangibly works through friends and relationships. By my avoiding depth of relationship, I deny myself and these others the love and grace of God that can be exemplified, not to mention the fulfillment we feel in satisfying the need to know and be known. I am essentially saying, “God, I don’t trust You. You’re lying to me and I’m not going to give You the chance to prove me wrong.” Yet, He still finds ways of doing so even despite my best efforts.</p>

<p>This sort of leads me into thinking how little I really walk in the Spirit. To clarify, I mean the process of cognitively giving over my fleshly limitations and shortcomings as a man and actively seeking God’s will to act and think like His Son, Jesus Christ. My overuse of sarcasm is a glaring example of how I <em>don’t</em> walk in the Spirit oftentimes. This <em>not</em> walking in the Spirit occurs in the worst of times. I don’t really mean worst; I think most trivial would be more accurate. I am around a group of solid Christians in most of these situations. People who would not hurt a fly (in a lot of cases), yet I fear for my eternal life when it comes to the people. Baffling, isn’t it?</p>

<p>There are so many great things said in the Bible about walking in the Spirit. Not that I’m endorsing drunkenness, but Paul relates being filled with the Spirit to being drunk. I doubt he’s referring to a sloppy drunk slurring their words and stumbling over their own shadow. I think he’s saying that walking in the Spirit really enables us to most be the person we want to be deep down inside; the person we were intended and created to be. We are, when filled with the Spirit, like our own Tyler Durden, free in every way imaginable. I mean free not as to promote licentiousness, but as uninhibited. We are enabled to move beyond our own limitations and insecurities and rely on the strengthening only provided by the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>Why on earth would I not want to become Superman? That’s pretty much the image I get of the Spirit-filled life. Sure, you’re not flying around in blue and red spandex, but you are far more capable than your Clark Kent self without the Spirit. I think that’s really cool having grown up watching Superman cartoons. Cheesy. Where is my hangup on living out the desire to both serve the God I claim to love and do something with my life that carries significance?</p>

<p>I don’t know if I have the energy or ability to flesh this out completely, but I look back to John Piper’s breakdown of Philippians 1:21–25 in <em>Don’t Waste Your Life</em>. I believe it is because I do not value God in the way He deserves to be valued. In other words, I have idols that I have placed in my life above God. I worship other gods and idolize them in a way the can never satisfy or fulfill. Lord, I trust in You, but help my unbelief. I can identify with the father who said this to Christ. I do believe that He is more valuable than any gift or thing I can receive in this life, but I find it extremely hard to believe this to the point of living it out every second of every minute of every day.</p>

<p>I think that’s part of the point of this life here on earth. I’m not meant to get it all, but someday I will. I’m incapable and ignorant, but I am loved and valued as if I were flawless. Oh, the way I know God loves me, is so great that I lack the faculties to begin to understand. His love for this broken sinner is like He, infinite.</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p>I physically wrote this down a week ago, but life exploded into activity later that day, so I’m now transcribing it.</p>

<p>I don’t know how this’ll flow, but let’s see. Just trying to jot some thoughts down for a blog…</p>

<p>Random, but just passed by a truck transporting pigs in a manner that reminded me of a WWII concentration camp transport. Packed like…compacted garbage, I suppose. It gave me significant distaste to the point of swearing off pork at least for a little while. A <em>good</em> little while.</p>

<p>Stories. Being the “new guy”, I have shared mine a few times in recent memory. We all have one. Of course, they’re different. They are as different as the one to whom each belongs. While they’re different, they’re also messy. I don’t mean messy as in dirty, though. I mean it in the way that a parent sees their child’s finger painting and this it a masterpiece. I think this is the way God sees each of our stories. They are gritty and real, but with the poetry of a heavenly sonnet. Yes, a sonnet. Each story tells the unfolding love story of a beneficent Savior to His love. This, I feel, is how we are to hear each story.</p>

<p>I don’t know what spurred it, but this thought on the way home from work led me to ask the question of what comes next and what is truly the purpose of this year? This is a question that I’ve been wrestling with for a while. It seems to fit the title of this blog and a name I have assumed for myself. This year, a crossroads where I begin to forge an identity no longer defined by anything forced upon me. It seems this identity is a tabula rasa with infinite possibility only feasible away from all things known. This year is but another stop on the road of the wayward journeyer. I am a mess, but very little of this mess am I actually tied to. This mess, not owned by me can be laid down over the course of this year. So it seems this is to be a year of self-discovery and definition. I do not know where this will lead, just as I don’t know where God has my path going after this year. And so I bide my time. I wait with excitement. In that vein, it seems this will become a weekly occurrence.</p>

<p>The ramblings of an ignorant single, young in the ways of the world and young at heart. I may not have much insight to offer, but what I lack, I would like to think I make up for in introspection and sheer quantity of words haha.</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p>Today was an interesting day. For me to actually blog, I feel it must be. Work was…OK, so work has nothing to do actually with this post. I looked at an…we can forget the petty back story as well. I was on my way to the house where I’m staying when <em>it</em> happened. I looked away for a split second and the next thing I know, I see a black sedan (Chevy Malibu, I think) careening across a lane of traffic and crunching into the concrete dividing wall. I slowed and my heard and head both pounded simultaneously arrhythmically. It was a scary sight. Yet, being one of, if not <em>the</em>, closest vehicle to the crash, I did not stop. A car had just gotten mangled right in front of me from its interaction with a larger sized commercial truck and all I could do was avoid the debris scattered across the roadway…</p>

<p>Immediately, I was seized by my response, or the lack thereof. Sure, maybe I wasn’t exactly the best witness there, but I at least could have had the presence of mind or even decency to have made a simple emergency call. I could have stopped to see if anyone was in a life threatening situation that could have been aided, but NO. None of the above were even contemplated until <em>I</em> was safely out of harm’s way.</p>

<p>I could go on about my lack of response, but that would only serve to be self-deprecating and would serve no one in the end. Instead, I will return to the reasons for why later and move on with the plot.</p>

<p>I was a good couple miles down the road before conscious thought reentered my feeble and shaken mind. I started to panic at my disregard and contemplated turning around, but then I saw an ambulance jetting in the direction I had just came from and realized that would be a bad idea. Then, I quickly shifted to thinking about what I <em>needed</em> to take away from the experience, once again my brain racing. Then, it hit me.</p>

<p>I know I am very guilty of this and I feel I may not be the only one, but I was using my logic and rationale to avoid the emotional nature of the event that had just occurred. There is an emotional response we have to bigger events that I realized in that moment I could not just reason and rationalize away. I needed to own my response in all its components. I needed to feel the fear, experience the rush of adrenaline, delve into the depths of sadness that in this broken world come from the realization that there are awful things that happen that were originally never meant to. This last point brings about a score of emotions, but at that moment the primary one was sadness.</p>

<p>I let go. I took the fall and just let go in this instant. “Come now, just let it go. Let it fall down. Let it all flow like the water that’s rushing in over your soul ‘till there’s nothing left. Won’t you come to Me and rest?” — “Rest” by Nevertheless</p>

<p>In case you may have been wondering, yes, I had pretty much planned this out on the rest of the ride home, but I couldn’t tell you a word that I had in my head. Now that I got that out of the way, my takeaway from the situation. One, I’m far too far from God throughout the day. My life should be a constant prayer to, an ongoing conversation with, God. It’s not at all. I am far too comfortable with meeting with Him a few seconds a few times a day at meals and when I go to bed. My life resembles that of an estranged tenant. “Hey there, just checking in. Later!” That’s pretty much my interaction with God throughout the day and that’s just deplorable and sad.<br />
Two, I am not who I claim to be. I am no good Samaritan. I am no saint looking to help any and all in need. I am the guy who sees need and his first concern is his own safety and comfort. I am wrapped up in this tiny world in which I live, population: me. Life, while rather unassumingly so based on outward appearance, revolves in its entirety around myself. I am consumed with my “needs” and desires.<br />
Finally, and possibly most importantly, life on this earth is completely and utterly uncertain. I do not know whether tomorrow will bring about a new dawn or if I will be in a freak car accident on my way home from work and my life will be required of me. Frankly, I don’t know that I won’t die before the next keystroke and I won’t be able to finish this novel-length blog post. There are millions of possibilities for each instant of my life and I cannot predict what the next moment will bring, so I need to plan accordingly. I’m not dead yet, so I need to live this life like I could be. I’m not saying that I need to live every day like it’s my last, because that could in some cases lead to licentiousness. Instead, I wish to live each moment in such a way that I would not regret it if it were my last or one of my last. What is it that I’m living for? Who am I doing this for? If I can answer those two questions and be proud of that answer, then I feel that this life will be well lived and worthwhile.</p>

            <p>Breaking my rule once again, I kinda planned out this post on my run yesterday. The only thing is, that was <em>yesterday</em>. Let me back up a little, first.</p>

<p>So, I’ve been up here at the office working a “real” job over two weeks now and I’ve had a good amount of time to settle in. I’m the “tech guy” so based on the title alone I feel important, however it’s more of a feeling than truth as I really haven’t done anything more than some simple troubleshooting. OK, so I can’t do the surfacey, catch-you up crap any longer.</p>

<p>I feel like there’s a lot on my mind, but when I go to think about what it is, I just go blank. I feel like a dam, but because what’s ready to spill out is greater than the opening, it all just gets stuck at the threshold. Frustrating to say the least.</p>

<p>On my run yesterday, (sorry for being so scatterbrained) I realized how much we as human beings <em>love</em> to stare. I was running along a semi-busy road yesterday evening and I kid you not, every passing car had at least one set of eyes intently on me. Yes, I know what you’re thinking. And, yes, I know this because I was staring right back at every one of them. Why, though? I think a part of this has to do with our God-given tendency to be curious. I think another part of the puzzle is also our nature to observe our environment primarily through sight. How many of us just ignore things around us that are new and possibly foreign? I know I lack that ability. Of course, if you didn’t lack this ability, then you probably wouldn’t know about it haha. Anyway, I know my own tendency when confronted with something/someone new is to observe it as carefully as possible. I guess this really does help lend support to the claim that we, moving on to my second conjecture, observe our environment overwhelmingly through our eyes. I realize that any other method would be highly impractical and weird, but I was just fascinated by the mutual interest generated as I ran alongside the road.</p>

<p>So, I’ve mentioned multiple times how much I love music. I will proceed to do this again. I live roughly 50 minutes in rush hour traffic from the office, so I have a little time to kill once I hop in the car. I hate feeling like I’ve wasted time (i.e., my life) so I quickly realized that I needed to find something to do in that time to be “productive”. Lord, thank You for music. I decided music was the answer. I must be one of the more fun people to watch, because each morning is a worship session where I am performer and audience (well, the only segment of the audience I can hear). It’s such a huge blessing. I get to come into work everyday having at least a half hour of solid worship music. I don’t know about you, but that’s about the best way I can think of to start a day.</p>

<p>On that note, I come to the question of how to maintain a focus on Christ in the hours between my morning commute and going to bed. It’s easier to focus on Him when you have “God of Wonders” for instance blaring in the car, but not so much when staring at a computer screen or in the middle of a morning-long meeting. If I claim myself to follow Christ, I also have to consider my thoughts as conforming to this pursuit. Paul speaks of holding every thought captive to Christ in 2 Corinthians 10:5, so it’s obviously important. This saddens me even more, because of how important it is compared to how much I focus on this area. I think of the song “Everything” by Tim Hughes. If you haven’t heard it, the song is a great worship piece about how God should be in every aspect of our lives as Christians. I understand that I am human and imperfect, but God is most certainly <em>not</em> in every aspect of my life. It would be a lie to assert He is even in a majority of my life. Don’t think I am trying to be a glass-half-empty person right now, because I really am an optimist (questionable given the previous topics of this blog haha). Anyway, all this just to say that it confirms once more my desperate need for grace and sanctification.</p>

<p>Mentioning Tim Hughes reminded me of something I may regret making “public” to all but the person or two who may read this one rainy day while they are bored and accidentally happen across this post. Worship music played most in churches really bugs me. Well, it doesn’t bug me, as I like most of the songs. That being said, an overwhelming majority of these songs are simply too neat and pretty. My observations over the past couple decades tell me this life is anything but neat or pretty. Existence on this earth is gritty and oft messy (use of the word ‘oft’ just made me incredibly happy). While I’m singing songs like “Here I Am to Worship” I can’t help but think, “I really wish I thought God were the most wonderful thing to me.” Let’s face it, in a lot of cases (pardon the assumption) GOD IS NOT THE MOST IMPORTANT OR WONDERFUL THING. This is why I have idols and other gods in my life. I am interested in the new iPods coming out next week, because in some ways I value them above God. Why then should my praise and worship not mirror this lack of dedication to my Lord and Savior? Why do so few songs sung in the few churches I have attended in recent months reflect and acknowledge this condition? Maybe I have a hyper-focus on my fallen and imperfect nature, but I doubt this focus is completely sinful. I feel there has to be at least a grain of truth in this rant. I’m not suggesting that our songs completely shift and only talk about how broken we are, because that’s prideful. I’m thinking of songs like “Satisfy” by Tenth Avenue North, where fleshly desire is recognized and then God is sought to overcome this shortcoming. Alright, I’ll get off my soapbox…for now.</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p>I find it extremely difficult that God could be perfect. Perfection does not exist on this earth, therefore I do not understand it. I know that I am not supposed to understand perfection, just as I am not to understand God’s infinite nature. However, I have been hurt too much to want to give into a perfectly benevolent being. I do not trust God to not hurt me as friends and family have done in the past. I do not want to trust God to be…God.</p>

<p>I started this post over a week ago, and sadly just now am I getting back to it. Much has happened since this thought entered my fragile, little brain. However, the thought is no less true or life-altering today than it was in its infancy.</p>

<p>Here is the crux of the problem: it is not necessarily my finite capacity or my past, but it is simply me. In other words, I make this issue about me, myself and my pride. Do you see it? Because I am holding onto perceived hurts and pains from my past, I cannot allow myself to fathom God being who He is and says He is.</p>

<p>Here I am back at war metaphor (I know that I am male and war metaphor seems manlier, but I do typically like to avoid it, just for the sake of avoiding the Christian cliche). I am caught between a war of affections. I am trying to serve two masters: God and myself. In so doing, I serve neither fully and no one is satisfied. I am caught in no man’s land and I’ve contented myself in a foxhole amidst the screaming shells and blazing explosions. Given enough time, I know I will not survive. This is no place to live a life. Sorry, now I will return from WWI haha.</p>

<p>I think the ultimate example of selflessness began with God in 1 John 4:10–11. He sent His son as a sacrifice for our sin when we did not consider Him a friend. I think about this and it blows me away. God sent the greatest gift one could give for those who did not love Him. He sent Christ to save His enemies. I do not love my enemies, let alone can I even pretend that I would think to sacrifice my only son so that they might be saved from some impending doom. Sorry, but I have to be honest on this one. Christ willingly walked to Calvary so that He might save me, before I had any knowledge of Him, before I called Him my Savior. Willingly! I could go on for a while, but I will cut myself off shortly.</p>

<p>What if I lived my life following this example? What if my relationships mirrored this? What if my interactions with my family showed this kind of sacrifice? I do not think that this is too much to ask or far fetched at all. What if I got beyond myself and my pride, even just for a moment a day to start..?</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p>The last week has gotten me thinking that I need to write about, well, where my life’s at and seems to be going. To clarify, I seem to have been thrust into a season of death and dying this past week. My mother went with my grandparents to visit her uncle who has stage 4 cancer last weekend. While they were there, they found out that one of her aunts had a heart attack. Two very different stories, however. The uncle, a story of gloom and hoping the Lord will save his soul. On the other hand, the aunt, a person ready to return home and because of her exuberance, one of her sons had accepted the Lord into his life after a decades long absence from church. I found all this out the day after I had learned that a friend here at school had been killed in an accident with a truck while on his bike. He was not my best friend in the world, but I could say that I knew him and he was a friend. I lack the words to truly express my thoughts and emotions, but I feel the need to try. He was biking back from feeding the homeless downtown and it makes me wonder. What is my impact on the world around me? Am I living out the faith I claim to have? Is not faith without works dead? I am not trying to advocate a system of self-sanctification, but I ask this practically. Can one really consider himself faithful if that faith does not manifest itself in obedience to Christ?</p>

<p>What about my urgency? It seems that I have none. I feel invincible and that my time will never run out, but life on this earth is fleeting. Nothing is guaranteed; nothing meant to last. I take the blessing of each day for granted, shamefully. Every breath, every thought, every word and every opportunity is to be taken advantage of and not let go to waste.</p>

<p>Wednseday, I decided to go for a run as it was drizzling and I was excitedly anticipating the forthcoming rain. I love running in a warm rain. This particular route runs through a quiet neighborhood and at the apex, I simply turn around to finish out the distance. I had gotten about a quarter of the way through the run (halfway out) when I realized the rainstorm that had progressed from the drizzle was actually a serious storm cell. Uncertain of what to do, I decided I was over halfway out, so I might as well go all the way. This proved to be a terrible/phenomenal idea. Every crash of thunder got subsequently louder and I got more and more concerned seeing as I was running beneath trees and power lines…FAIL. I can honestly say that I have prayed that seriously maybe a handful of times in my life. It’s a shame it took me concern for my very life to pray earnestly, but I’m glad for it. Roughly three-quarters of the way through the run, the sky began to clear and the thunder and lightning ceased.</p>

<p>I wish I could say that my prayer life is great, but that run clearly showed me that it’s nowhere near where it should be. Prayer is to be a continuing conversation throughout the day and not just when we fear the worst for ourselves. Urgency, once again, came to mind. What purpose am I living for? If I were to have died then, would I have been able to say that I had been a faithful and obedient servant? Can I consider myself a servant at all? Am I spending my time on things worthwhile? Or am I simply wasting my life on lesser things?</p>

<p>I don’t answer these questions, because unfortunately I think I know the answer to all of them and that’s not the point here. Of course this begs the question of what really is the point? Maybe, it’s simply to address the questions whose answers may look different for each individual. Maybe, it’s simply to express the random thoughts and questions floating around in my raging sea of a brain.</p>

<p>I went to a conference this weekend back at home and I had many thoughts running rampant through my already busy head. It was so incredibly weird staying in a hotel less than 10 minutes from my Dad’s house. We went to the mall for dinner Saturday where I go shopping when I’m back at home. There were a few people from school there, which was nice to provide some sort of balance in the Picasso-like weekend that it was. It was like being in the twilight zone where my past life melded with my current life and I was stuck trying to reconcile the two. Needless to say, I did not sleep much. It was certainly fun getting to meet some new and cool people and the informational sessions were not too bad. However, it was a significant struggle being thrown off so much. The stress of the week just melded in with the duplicity of the weekend, which melded in with the anxiety presented by graduation. In light of this, I walked around the area alone for about 2 hours Friday night. I don’t know specifically what it accomplished, but I felt it was needed. Saturday was a little more normal, but I still felt conflicted. Today, a friend drove back with me to school and we got lunch with my mother on the way back. It was pretty cool having her meet my mother and just the interaction we all had. The ride back was also rather enjoyable as the weather was beautiful, so we rode with the top down, music up and had some pretty good conversation.</p>

<p>The car ride I think helped me to understand that maybe, just maybe, the need we have to know others and be known by others is far more important than I’d like to admit. I am not the most candid and honest person and we’re not the best of friends, but I felt that I couldn’t hide anything from her. Fulfilling this need was more important to me than the desire to self-preserve and hide in the conversation. Nope, I don’t really know where I’m going with this other than to say that honesty, even with people not terribly well known is freeing. Openness and honesty is so much more freeing and simple. I wish I would have more conversations of this sort…</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p>I’m not going to taint this post with beginning by any statement of personal holiness or righteousness. I’ve not been the person I’d like to be all the time, but this is not to say I’m trying to claim Satan’s best messenger boy either. Either way you put it, nothing’s been fantastic in my conduct. Yes, it’s past 1 in the morning. Yes, it’s also Friday and I have work in a few short hours, but no, I need to do something that makes me feel active right now rather than sleep. I’m not trying to diminish my need for sleep, but it just seems to take a bit of a backseat at the current moment. This week’s been rather uneventful other than the puppies getting their shots and slowly trickling out of the house (having taken one to work with me this morning to give to my Dad to give to a cousin of mine as a birthday gift) and the little thing or the other that’s come up but right now seems of little importance in the grand scheme of things. I honestly have to ask myself what is so important about this post that I have to post it now, but I’m really having trouble figuring out what that is. While I’m thinking of that, I will relate my evening. It began with my brother arriving at the office around 2:30 or so. He was actually an hour earlier than I had expected which threw me off a tad, but nothing to worry about. I was able to stave off leaving early with him for about an hour when he and I went and grabbed Einstein Bros. iced coffees together (cute I know). We then returned to the office and just hung out for awhile until my dad and uncle were both ready and we all went to a nice half-indoor-half-outdoor bar not far from the office and just caught up and had a good time with one another. My uncle left sometime around 8, my dad around 8:30 and my brother and I didn’t leave until after 9. I was supposed to go see Transformers with my friend Ryan and his girlfriend, however I thought it wise to tell them to just enjoy the movie without me seeing as I had no idea when I might get out to their place, let alone when I would be ready to then get to a theater. I hadn’t and still haven’t eaten dinner, but that was supposed to be taken care of when I met my brother at the restaurant he had specified after he had to run a quick errand. I stupidly decided to park 5 blocks up from the restaurant thinking it was going to be the next intersection (WRONG!). My phone was dying, so I texted Ryan alerting him of my plight and he replied that I should just go to his place and my brother would meet us there. This was a little after 11 maybe…I can’t tell you how far I walked or where exactly I have been, but the walk took me over an hour and a half of being lost to find the right apartment as the street it’s on has two distinct sections that don’t connect =/. No worse for the wear, I arrived sometime after 12:30 completely drenched in sweat, but nevertheless glad to finally be where I had planned on being with the odyssey and subsequent attempt to page the right apartment for nearly another 15 minutes haha.</p>

<p>Something I did not expect to learn/hear again (COMPLETELY SWITCHING GEARS) is that I can’t be anyone’s white knight. I can’t flawlessly come onto the scene and swoop in, saving the princess and living happily ever after. Life simply doesn’t work that way. Being blunt, I screw up and I screw up a lot. I’m not saying I screw up more than the “average” man, but I certainly screw up no less, that I guarantee. So, let’s cut the crap and I can just be who I am. The chivalry in me I cannot kill, but the air of perfection just doesn’t cut it. I am not perfect, never have been, never will be. Therefore, I can be the black knight, the guy who you kinda want to root for, but you know he has some definite character flaws and when he does get the girl, you can’t really boo, but you’re not disillusioned into thinking he’s Prince Charming or anything fantastical like that. I guess that’s not much of a breakthrough, as it actually originated as a somewhat random, off-the-cuff comment made to a friend in which I was actually half-kidding, but saw the greater truth upon reflecting on this comment. I think this just adds more proof to the thought that I should follow my own advice, even when I may offer it in a joking manner.</p>

<p>I’m going to keep this brief as I need sleep, but I’m definitely stoked for this weekend seeing Mat Kearney later on today and then Rascal Flatts on Saturday with my sister. I love music, something I may have mentioned before, so this is really going to be a treat getting to hang out with a slightly different grouping of friends for Mat and then getting to spend the next day with the sis. Yeah, you could say I’m most definitely stoked. To make things even better, I’ll be down in the Outer Banks starting Tuesday night and then in VA Beach Friday to Sunday for the 4th. Despite my lack of spiritual satisfaction at the moment, I do have a lot else to look forward to on the very near horizon. That being said, I really do want to work on being more Christ-centered in my day-to-day life especially in the aspects of prayer and giving up even the mundane to Him. Night!</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p>This is coming far later than I had planned towards the end of last week. I was actually really looking forward to posting this past Friday or Saturday at the very latest, but such is life. I don’t think a ton has happened since my last mini-post, so it shouldn’t make too much of a difference.</p>

<p>Last week ended rather well with few hiccups or other events making life significantly less enjoyable. There was an issue that had been swimming around the stormy ocean of my mind and I think I finally was granted some clarity through a conversation with my dad Friday afternoon at work no less. I really do value those times when he and I sit down and have a true heart-to-heart conversation, because I’m still trying to figure out in earnest, who this man is. This pursuit is made much more difficult however when I realize that I still have no clue who I myself am.</p>

<p>I realized from the conversation and following revelation of sorts that while I claim to be open to questioning my habits and beliefs, I still hold on to certain relationships in my life despite knowing in my heart that I want for things to change, making that relationship less valuable to myself than it could be. My point of view may sound rather self-centered, but to talk about the other person would be nothing more than speculation so I simply avoid the great unknown as it is to me. I am afraid of losing friends, of feeling left behind because I feel that changing the dynamics of a relationship could alter it so radically that the person no longer wants to be my friend, no longer thinks I’m valuable enough to keep around and then I’m just left sitting in their dust. The truth of the matter is that if they no longer want to remain friends, then the relationship was broken to begin with and is not something I need to hold onto in the first place. This life is far too short to worry about faulty relationships that don’t build us up and glorify the one who ordained the relationship in the first place. This means we must be willing to sacrifice friends as well in the name of advancing the kingdom in the world and in our hearts. If we are to be filled with the Spirit, then there is no room for that which brings death and destruction. Relationships, all relationships take a significant amount of work. If my relationship with someone doesn’t require work, or I don’t believe it could use some work in one area or another, then I am either lying to myself or I don’t genuinely care about that relationship or person, probably even both. I know I have my work cut out for me, but I’m only doing what’s been laid out before me. I’ve been given the tools, the energy and I will be given the opportunity. What more could I ask for in this pursuit?</p>

<p>“He restores my soul. He leads me in paths of righteousness for his name’s sake. Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me; your rod and your staff, me. You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies; you anoint my head with oil; my cup overflows.” — Psalm 23:3–5</p>

<p>I feel a little cut off from Christian community when I am home, therefore I liken being home a little to the valley of the shadow of death from the passage, but He is everything I need and more. I have nothing to fear, because He is the Great Provider and I will never be left wanting, no matter the circumstances. I wish I could remember this more often.</p>

<p>I also feel like I’ve been experiencing a bit of a drought musically on top of the spiritual strain. One of my favorite and best releases is just playing and writing music. I haven’t been doing much of either, especially the latter. I am wasting a gift, one of oh so many. I guess it comes down to a bit of a time management issue, but it’s deeper than that I feel. I think I am becoming both apathetic and self-centered as I come home everyday and do something for myself, eat dinner and then either continue the trend or maybe talk a little with my mom or sister. This isn’t satisfying, nor is it where I believe I should be right now. I just don’t know what He wants for me right now. But, am I seeking Him earnestly..?</p>

I never thought it would come to this, but it most certainly has. I don’t think this to be a sign of the apocalypse, but it’s definitely not all that far off haha. I plan on posting much more in the coming day or two, but this will have to suffice for now. Yes, I am alright and no, my head is screwed on no more loosely than at any other time in my life, but today is a new and glorious day even with the drizzle and overcast sky above me.

          <div class="entry">
            <p>Hopes are interesting things in my mind. Many people in our lives have different hopes for us. Also, many people have similar hopes for us. What I find most interesting, however is not their actual hopes, but how they convey them to us. This sounds really odd, but the way in which they share these hopes with us makes all the difference in the hope being placed within us or placed upon us. I will use as an example, the hope for success. For instance, your grandparents might wish you success, but then qualify it as something you must continually strive for in life. I do not think this at all wrong, mind you, but this is now a hope that has been placed upon you. It is a hope that can weigh you down in a sense and wear you down. A hope is something I prefer to be instilled in the designated person. I wish success for my loved ones, but I guess what I’m trying to say is that I want to allow them the ability to accept my well-wishing and then decide for themselves if they actually want to take that hope and strive toward it. In other words, I do not wish to force my hopes upon those who I am trying to bless with those hopes.</p>

<p>Metaphorically speaking, hopes placed upon us are like heaping rocks on our backs while trying to hike up a mountain. You may make it up, but it would have been far easier if you did not have the rock on your back in the first place.</p>

<p>OK, so it’s time to share my philosophical metaphor on life. I came up with this (though it’s not original) when I was a junior in high school and have tweaked it some and expect to continue to tweak it, but I really like it. Life is like surfing a huge wave. All we really need to do is just go with the flow and let life take us where it will. Don’t focus on the past, because you’ll miss the shark in front of you getting ready to rip you shreds. Also, don’t work too hard, because the current is simply too strong. You can paddle as hard as you want, but remember, you’re paddling against a monster wave so you won’t really get anywhere. I do not advocate apathy, because there are definitely times when we need to steer away from maybe someone else who may be getting ready to wipe us out or that obstacle that pops out of the water at the last second. Finally, life is simple. We try to complicate it with all this technology, clubs, activities and knowledge, but for what gain? All it does is takes our eyes off the journey, the true experiences and joy we should be finding in the everyday. I mean, what’s not to enjoy about catching the biggest wave you’ve ever seen and just riding it out?</p>

<p>I feel like there’s so much more that I want to write about, but I can’t think of a single topic, therefore I will end this right now.</p>

            <p>OK, so enough is enough. I, as I’m sure most, have been inundated with “updates” on the controversy surrounding Obama’s honorary degree from and graduation speech at Notre Dame University. I have to admit, I do not agree with abortion (unless under rather severe circumstances) but this controversy is beyond idiotic. For one second, let’s get over the fact that whether we voted for him or not, Obama is our president. His beliefs are not the issue to me. What is the issue here is the extreme hypocrisy being extended towards him. I do not wish to point fingers, however I find it incredible how this group of people can be protesting, heckling, etc. a person who simply believes in abortion, yet a Catholic priest who sodomizes young boys is given far better treatment and with far less media attention. This is an absolute outrage and personally, very upsetting. As people who believe in Christ, we have an obligation to love those with different beliefs and lifestyles from our own, but here I only see hate. I do not have any ties with Obama other than the respect owed to the President of the United States, but even that impersonal tie is enough for me to truly feel for this man who is afflicted for a single belief in his expansive <em>set</em> of beliefs. What makes this even more inane is the fact that the belief under attack is something that would never in a million years be brought up in a commencement speech, especially by someone such as the President.</p>

<p>Sadly, this points to a greater issue in Christianity. This hypocrisy cited in this specific issue is not limited to this instance by any stretch of the imagination. Myself included, Christians represent some of the most paradoxically hypocritical set of ideals witnessed today. Publicly we preach love and show others how tolerant, kind and charitable we are, but deep down, we still are no better than <em>anyone</em>; no, not even Hitler. Let’s get over ourselves, because while we have been given many gifts, we ourselves are not God’s gift to the world, we just chose to accept Him.</p>

            <p>Where is my joy? Where is my devotion? As I write this, scratch that, type this (I have no idea how to correctly type this stream of consciousness, sorry) out into the great blackness that is the blogosphere I should be in bed as I have an exam that I need to be getting up early in order to complete preparation for, yet I feel I need this. I feel as if I am in need of some sort of release of the tension that is my waiting, bracing for the next 48 hours or so. New Testament final at 9, meeting with a professor to determine my final grade in his class, Philosophy 100 review all tomorrow (maybe). Tuesday, meeting with the boss to go over performance and talk about next semester at 7:30 IN THE MORNING!!! Then, I have my philosophy final at 2, oh, and I can’t forget that I need to complete this stupid robot project for my software development class that has its final run at 9 in the morning. To admit that I’m stressed would only be affirming the already all too obvious.</p>

<p>Who freaking cares? What sort of trial or discomfort is this really providing? Why am I so content with wading in my self-pity and, ugh the word isn’t coming to me at this time of night. This gloominess is just pathetic and unenjoyable, therefore I’m done with it. This is just so trivial. So I’m dealing with a couple days of absolute busyness…yes, go on.</p>

<p>Rather than complaining, I could be spending that brainpower (I can use all I can muster at this point) and energy and do something at least marginally useful with it, such as devoting it to studying…hmm, that’s a brilliant thought. On a lighter note, I’m listening to “College Kids” by Relient K on Pandora, and I’m apt to agree with nearly every line in the song haha.</p>

<p>So, I bought the “I Are an Engineer” shirt the other day and after rereading it for the hundredth time or so, IT’S COMPLETELY TRUE!!! I’M UNMISTAKABLY A NERD! Oh, well…I think this is just one of those “if the shoe fits” moments.</p>

<p>I have to admit, I think this whole blogging idea has turned out rather well on my end. I’m sorry if you’re reading this drivel as it’s probably just shy of mindless but take solace in the fact that at least I feel somewhat better as a result =P. I must be tired, because emoticons don’t happen on this blog. Whatever.</p>

<p>“Now may the Lord of peace Himself continually grant you peace in every circumstance.”</p>

<p>II Thes. 3:16</p>

<p>=) this is a depiction of my face after reading this, because He always does…when I don’t slap away His ever-giving hand. And then, I saw the verse of the day, II Chronicles 7:14 and it all confirms my self complaint and the desire to find peace in this tiny little squall that has blown into my life…it’s really not the hurricane I made it out to be just a little bit ago.</p>

<p>Peacefully yours,<br />
Cameron</p>

          <h2><a href="/know-your-enemy/">know your enemy</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>As a preface, this post comes from an ongoing conversation/stream of consciousness spawned this morning as I sat in philosophy trying to pay attention, but failing miserably.</p>

<p>So, there was this guy sitting in front of me today complaining before class about his dysfunctional kidneys. As I had nothing better waiting for class to begin than to eavesdrop, I started to make fun of this guy in my head for being such a whiner. That’s when this thought slapped me in the face. We desire and almost need to complain for a reason. Complaining is merely an outlet for our souls. In our hearts, we recognize that this is not the way things were meant to be. We are longing for the perfection for which we were designed and created. Complaint is our acknowledging this fact and outwardly showing this agreement. I’m not advocating complaint here, I am simply trying to make sense of my own seemingly unending desire to complain.<br />
Ok, so I definitely ran out of time yesterday to come back to this as I had originally planned, so I am now on day two of this post. i definitely see a monster post coming soon haha.<br />
I really do love the weather we’re having today with the sunshine, the warmth and the breeze, but as with all nice days, I have to be out in it, therefore I cannot see a thing that I am typing because I’m wearing polarized sunglasses and trying to look at a dim screen in this abundant sunlight. I ask you to forgive the probably difficulty faced in reading this in light of these facts.<br />
Along with the weather, today in general has been wonderful. Yes, I spent some time sitting in front of this screen working on a project that is due early next week, but I also enjoyed the heck out of myself doing it for some strange reason. I also had class right after that and even that was relatively bearable haha.<br />
I have even more respect for swimmers after this week given my 2 failed attempts at swimming. I understand completely why swimmers have the best overall fitness of any athlete. It is an entire body workout that is also cardio-intensive. My personal best is 8 laps, pathetic I know. However, after those laps (not all in succession mind you, there were breaks involved) I was on the verge of wishing death to relieve the deep aching in my entire body that was being made worse by even standing still in the pool. To reiterate, I am pathetic haha. This must be the masochist in me, but I love it despite all these things.<br />
Now I switch from the deep of the pool to the deep of life. Today, I had freedom spelled out to me in my reading of “The Ransomed Heart”. I went through an entire bible study this semester on freedom in Christ, yet I could not summarize it to save my life. It hit me that I live in a voluntary slavery. I have clasped the chains of unforgiveness and hate and contented myself within these confines. Freedom is being able to give to others, love others and be disappointed. I do not love in the reckless manner to which I am called, therefore I cannot be disappointed or hurt. This is my thinking, but it is horribly flawed. I am hurting myself by not allowing the possibility of great, lasting relationships or even the wisdom in pain and hurt, so that I might avoid a temporary pain that is less than desirable. O, ye of little faith. If I believe God to be infinitely powerful and caring, then who can touch me? I have literally nothing to fear. However, it is all too obvious that I do not trust God to this degree. There is a disconnect between my head knowledge and my very heart. Deep down, I have buried this desire, need and dependence upon Him, for some nonsensical reason. I have convinced myself this reason is legit, but now that I am reflecting on it, I couldn’t even tell you what it was, let alone its legitimacy.<br />
Here’s to beautiful days that remind us that He does care for our well being and wants us to be happy. And here’s also to truly being free to enjoy this great promise.</p>

<p>I really need to listen to myself…</p>

<p>I almost forgot the title of this post.<br />
This post is titled in honor of Green Day’s new single. I was listening to it yesterday and it got me thinking. I completely took nearly everything out of context, but this decontextualization makes a lot of sense to me. First of all, there is an enemy out there and I know I need to be aware of him constantly. I, alas, am not. Not only do I need to be aware of him, but I need to be actively fighting against him and not staging some polite quiet protest. I need to be staging an all out revolutionary war on this force that I have allowed to permeate my life and soul. “Silence is the enemy, so give me, give me revolution!” On this note I leave you.</p>

          <h2><a href="/3-weeks/">3 weeks?!</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>I think it’s been 3 weeks since I’ve posted last. That’s a really long time. Has life really been that busy or have I just gotten that lazy? I’m kind of hoping neither, but in my surprise, I’m not really sure either way. Well, it’s almost Easter and this semester has absolutely flown by. Where the time since January went, I have no clue. I’m in a shirt and tie right now, which to anyone who knows my usual attire is a huge improvement, and it’s because I have to give a stupid presentation for software development. Now you know my sentiments on the matter. That wasn’t even a complete thought, as the original one got derailed immediately by my attire and class thoughts. Back to what I was saying. I actually like wearing the dressy duds. Looking nice is a welcomed change, especially when you look around you and know you’re quite possibly the best dressed person within a 20 foot radius. Ok, I promise I’m done with my narcissism haha.<br />
I’d love to go into what has happened in my life in the last several weeks since my last post, but that would take ages I feel and I would forget at least half of it, so I’m just going to save everyone the time and effort. Anyway, prayer. This is the one word I’m using to sum up where I’ve been, or at least what I’m struggling with currently. I have to admit, I’ve been inundated at times with the “power of prayer” and its importance, but I’m finally beginning to see why and what all that really means. To answer the “why” question very briefly, it’s a simple matter of the fact that we were made to be in constant fellowship with God. I finally see how much I can have to say to Him, even when I only focus on Him for maybe a tenth of my waking moments. This foretaste has left me seeing there is more. It’s hard for someone like myself who does not believe Him to be who He says He is, because this really messes with the point of prayer. We pray, I pray because I can’t do everything for myself. When it comes right down to it, I can’t do much of anything at all for myself. He doesn’t have those physical, mental, emotional, spiritual restrictions that I do. Not only is He infinitely more capable than I am, but He is also compassionate and wants to provide for me. I struggle with this second part, therefore prayer seems pointless to me at times. I don’t believe Him to be my ultimate provider, therefore I don’t come to Him unless I have turned to everywhere else I can imagine. I need to be in control of my life, my happiness, my future, that I also have issue with His wisdom. Partially, I feel Him to be a little restrictive, but moreover I feel that maybe I can just know His will without consulting Him first. WRONG!He is the one and only person in this world or the next that won’t disappoint me or let me down. He provides and comes through 100% of the time without fail, but how conveniently short is my memory. His ways and thoughts are far above my own, therefore how can I possibly hope to know Him unless He reveals Himself to me on His terms? I feel like I’m a rock trying to understand Einstein. Sorry, but despite my poor analogy, it just doesn’t make sense.<br />
I’m incredibly tired and worn down right now. I had a great weekend, relaxing and visiting family, but it wasn’t enough to make up for the sleep deficit I’ve been stocking up on the last couple weeks in particular. This week doesn’t look like it’ll provide any relief either, so I think I’m going to be needing to up my caffeine intake as well as my prayer outtake. That sounds so stupid the way I put it, but just know that it sounded good in my head. Just goes to show that I really don’t edit or filter my thoughts on this thing…Sure wish the weather would provide a much needed pick me up =/<br />
Happy Monday..!</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p>Well, I didn’t realize until just now that I haven’t posted in about a week and a half. This is a sure sign of my semester getting a little busier. I just don’t have time to post every day. I wish I could post more often, but such is life.<br />
I’ve spent the last couple days studying for intro philosophy and it’s been driving me nuts. I realize that I’m hell-bent on making the world black and white. The lack of absolute conclusions in the readings have really been getting to me and it took me until just now to understand that it’s because of this inability to accept gray areas. Life is much simpler with two choices rather than veritably infinite. Let’s face it, there is almost nothing that is absolute in this world. That’s just the way it is. However, I do believe there to be an absolute set of base morals and what makes the rest gray is each individual’s application of these absolute morals to various situations. This doesn’t sound terribly earth shattering, I know it’s not, but coming from someone in such great denial of the color gray in decisions, this is a bit of a stretch for me.<br />
I wish I had a little more to say, maybe something of a little more…substance, I guess, but I’m tapping out right now.</p>

            <p>Where to begin? It’s been a long time, an eternity it seems, since my last post and I feel there are nearly a million ways this post could go, but I guess once again we shall just have to find where the keys take me.<br />
I have to say, I love taking trips, but I despise getting ready for them. Spring break was amazing, however the week before was atrocious. To call that week an uphill battle would be a blatant understatement. I do not claim my work this semester to be taxing or grueling, however the anticipation of the upcoming rest and relaxation was almost too much to bear. It made everything that week seem so much more draining and wearing on the body, nerves and spirit. I think it goes without saying at this point that there was a significant misplacement of hope in this trip. I could go on about the trip itself, but to keep it short, I had a great time with my housemate enjoying the weather for the most part, the scenery and some of the interesting people we met onboard and on land in Grand Cayman and Ocho Rios.<br />
OK, so I feel something far more pressing at hand which really stood out to me today as I was studying for a test coming up on Wednesday. It’s been well established that I think, live, breathe, love music, so the fact that once again a song has an impact on my life should be pretty commonplace. “Free to Fail” by VOTA, whose name I think speaks for itself, was a gentle reminder that I do not have to live a perfect life otherwise mine would have been over in early childhood. I say this somewhat jokingly, but the fact is that I, like many, have screwed up so many times, but it’s OK. It’s a bit like beating a dead horse to many, but I needed this reminder. He lived the perfect life so that I, who could never, do not have to. Emphasis on the phrase “who could never” because it’s an absolute truth. I don’t care who you are, there is no way I or anyone else could argue to the contrary. You know what? That is alright with me. Yes, there is definitely a part of me that wishes I could, but honestly, the burden is far too great. I am not my own savior, I cannot be anyone else’s because I am incapable of bearing that on my two shoulders. All that is expected of me in this life is to lovingly submit myself to the grace and love showered on me constantly by a God who provides and cares more than anyone on this earth has and could possibly. When I stop and smell the rose that is His love, it is sweeter than anything else, but how often do I do this? How often do I get over my machismo and allow myself to be taken care of when I have needs that are real and cannot be met by another? Oh, He is good. It is by His unfathomable grace that I am still in relationship with the God of the Universe, most intimate friend and, yes, lover that has, does and ever will exist. All the times I have betrayed this divine romance, I do not deserve to be in the same universe as this God, but He calls me son. What more can I say?</p>

            <p>So, I love the Fray. Their new album took a little while to grow on me, but it certainly has. My favorite song without doubt, well, I love at least 3/4 of the album but my favorite is “Absolute”. Just listen to the song and think about the lyrics and I dare you not to like it. Ok, so I can’t really say that, but I really do like it.<br />
Yes, music pretty much surrounds about everything in my life. So, my group won the competition with our robot, which was hugely satisfying. It made the time and energy spent a little more worthwhile.<br />
There’s so much that I want to talk about right now, but I don’t have a lot of time given the fact that I have to leave for bible study in a few, but I will try to make this quick. There’s a lot of anger that I harbor toward God, I realized from going through the prep for my bible study. It went along nicely with the message from last night. Things that I thought were long in the past, are only in the past as far as people are concerned. However, I still hold God responsible for letting these things happen. It’s not the way I would have done things and I think that somehow my way would have been better. I’m not willing to get over my pride and admit that I am not God and I will not understand His ways as they’re far above and beyond my own. There will be trouble in this world, but what I don’t see and understand is that this trouble is to have its perfect and desired result. God doesn’t cause calamity, because it is not His way to harm us, but He does allow us to be stretched in different ways that He might be glorified. The fact that He can use me at all in His big plan is completely overwhelming. How He can use something as tainted and broken as me, I don’t understand. The beautiful thing is that I don’t have to and I can let my fear and anxiety go and just give my past, present and future over to one who is far beyond my own mental, physical and all other abilities. Thank God =)</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p>So, I apologize up front, this post will be disjointed at best. Today’s been a great day and because of the day’s excitement, I am certainly ecstatic and thus highly ADD.<br />
With that out of the way, I went snowboarding Friday. I’m pausing to let that statement sink in. It was a lot of fun, I have to say, but I earned that fun haha. I can’t count the number of butt-plants, face-plants and outright ugly falls I took, but it was an enriching experience which I’m surprised Brandon stuck around to aid. It definitely cemented the idea that I am much better off with both feet planted on terra firma. My mom joined us and we all drove to Wintergreen and shared stories, including some rather embarrassing ones about me and my childhood haha.<br />
I drove home after getting dinner with the aforementioned (I really like that word) people separately from my mom as I would hate to ask her to spend an entire day just so that she could drop me off at school unless completely necessary. So, we got home around 10:30 and continued to talk and catch up for the next 2+ hours when we realized it was late and got to bed. I love having conversations like that with my mom, because I do feel like she understands me at least for the most part.<br />
Saturday was glorious. I woke up on my own at 9:45, had a leisurely breakfast that my mom insisted on making (to which I could not fight, nor did I want to) and scheduled to get a late lunch with my dad. Lunch was great because, like my mom, I feel like my dad also gets me to a large extent. It’s nice having two parents who are so interested in your life. There’s a sense of value and importance that only parents can give through that. Anyway, we had a good conversation over Thai food and then went back to his townhouse and took a nap. That was simply INCREDIBLE. After the nap, we talked a little and then I drove back home to get ready to see the rest of the family at my aunt’s house (at least my dad’s side of it). I was really looking forward to the dinner at my aunt’s house, because as crazy and dysfunctional as my extended family is as a whole, they’re so much fun. Between playing rock band, being a human trampoline (yes, my cousin called me a trampoline), messing with the dogs, the conversation and joking and the food, I daresay (ooh, I like that word as well) it was a near perfect outing. Then, when we came back to the house, my sister and her friend wanted to go get Ben &amp; Jerry’s and watch Definitely, Maybe and so I drove them to the grocery store (a hilarious adventure) and then watched the first bit of the movie before deciding to go to bed in light of having to wake up earlier in the morning to get back for a group meeting at noon back at school =/.<br />
Ok, admittedly Sunday sucked for the most part. I had a two hour meeting the moment I got back. I can’t think of too many worse things to have to come back for, but I dealt. Right after that, I had another group meeting where we had to test our robot we’ve spent the last nearly four weeks building and programming for a lego search and rescue mission. This should be fun, but I’m burnt out on the project especially after the amount of time spent working last week on it. Once that was over, I went to church (I was bitter about the fact that I couldn’t even make the early service back home because of the first meeting) and heard a great message on the sixth commandment which deals with murder. I had a coffee meeting at 8:30, so I had to hurry and get to the gym which was great. Once I got out of the shower, I realized my 8:30 had been an hour early to Starbucks, so I rushed off and met her and we talked for a little over 2 hours, which was good. Ahh, long lost friends…Once I dropped her off at the library, I realized I hadn’t eaten dinner and it was 10:30…this seems to be my life in a nutshell.<br />
I opened at the coffee shop this morning (waking up was a real task). I do love working there. I saw someone who I hadn’t seen for the better part of a month and that was enough to brighten the rest of the morning…no, I’m not going to elaborate on that =D. The rest of today’s been somewhat boring, but it’s Monday and all that stands between the rest of the day and me is a little lab.<br />
So, I came to find last night that I have a vicious and violent heart. Though I don’t commit physical murder or do harm to others physically, there are times when I simply wish to in a sense do harm to others. So often do I do things which I thought were at least on the surface innocent, like getting slightly annoyed when someone cuts me off on the highway, or when someone does something little that I don’t appreciate. That thought that I could make things better, that they should be better and that I deserve better, it’s all violence of the heart. It’s an ill-will towards the way things or people are. I want to forcefully change things, and no, I don’t have to ability or right to do so. I am not the king or ruler of the universe, so things simply don’t go my way all the time and that’s just the way God’s ordained it. It just comes down to getting over myself and seeing the beauty in that which I do not immediately find it. I am such a whining complainer. It’s all because I’m unwilling to work and see things from a broader perspective. Where is the trust, the faith, the submission? I am still struggling with the idea that I, unlike Superman, need rest, that my mortality demands it. My soul and heart ache for it, yet I refuse to bow the knee and submit to the Almighty Creator and Conqueror of my heart. He is trying to make that which was tainted and evil, pure and good. Why can’t I accept His grace? Curse this pride. It just goes to show that I can be my greatest enemy, especially when He wants to be my greatest friend.</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p>As the title screams, yes, I planned this post a good deal.<br />
It all started this morning at work, which I wasn’t supposed to be opening today, but I agreed last night to cover for my exhausted boss for a couple hours. This meant that I went to bed early last night, which meant that after taking my “break” watching 5 episodes of Entourage season 3, I did zero studying. Around 7:15, “Boston” by Augustana came on the Pandora-playing iPod at work and right at the line in the song “I think I need a sunrise, I’m tired of the sunset…” I happened to look out the window and see an exquisite sunrise and I couldn’t help but chuckle to myself (only by virtue of no one else being in the shop) and think that was not by coincidence.<br />
Then, when I was on my way to grab some food after the stop at the gym early this afternoon, I saw a guy who, to the casual observer I was, appeared to have “assumed the position” and was urinating on a small bush by the e-school in broad daylight and without any noticeable cover. It was upon further review that I realized he had a shovel he had thrust into the dirt and was working it down further into the earth. My random awkward moment in my mind for the day…<br />
It was about at the same time, that “Fight Inside” by RED came on in my headphones and the song really resonated with me. On a tangential note, I’ve been in a real punk/grunge/hardcore kick recently, so the song should not come as a surprise. Anyway, the song is quite aptly titled as it is all about the spiritual struggle within and I couldn’t help but identify with it. I want sanctification, yet I don’t at the same time. There are factions within my members (I really like that phrase) that are truly at war within me and it makes things tough a lot of the time. This gives slightly different meaning to the term we Christians like to throw around, “broken.” In a very real sense, my affections have been split between God and Satan, good and evil. There are few things where saying this is satisfying, but I believe that in this life that is just the way of it. If even Jesus said, “No one is good, except for the Father,” then there doesn’t seem to be much hope in me overcoming all my fleshly desires. On the flip side, I don’t see there being much chance in me giving up the desires that have been placed in me by the Creator. So, this war will continue, but what will change is the territory of my heart that is occupied by the pure and good desires. Being someone who used to view life as a series of trials brought on by somewhat of an evil-scientist who liked to watch his subjects squirm, but eventually overcome, I try to avoid the war metaphor, but it seems all to applicable right now. There are simply times when God, in His most loving way, as to play the part of a conquering general. It is times like this where I feel like I’m at my wit’s end, that I just long to see Him riding into battle, guns blazing and looking at me with a huge, comforting smile indicating that everything is guaranteed to be perfectly fine. Sometimes, I like my God with a hearty helping of BA…</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p>The world might just stop spinning. Once again, I’ve missed a day…I’m sorry, I’m just making fun of myself right now. And, it’s now Wednesday and I’m about to the point of absolute exhaustion.<br />
Last night at bible study, I was able to better realize how fortunate I am from an emotional and mental standpoint. The bible study recapped Portico’s message about honoring one’s mother and father. As the talk centered around forgiveness and reconciliation, I could not help but feel convicted that I am more than blessed to have sought forgiveness and reconciliation in regards to my parents. For those of you who do not know, they are now divorced after the better part of five years being separated. There were significant effects in my life from that event that I came to terms with over the summer while out in Yellowstone. It is so true that we don’t appreciate the tings we have until they are the things we miss most. It wasn’t until I could not see my parents every day that I realized just how much they love me and care about me. It is because of that, I know the hurt that was caused as a result, direct or indirect, was never intentional. The pain I inflicted upon them was significantly less incidental. No, I have not worked everything out completely, but I have a good foothold and I feel so incredibly fortunate. I do not have to wake up one day 20 years down the road and wonder what happened to the relationship I had with my parents and maybe I do, maybe I don’t get the chance to fix things. Sure, my parents are not perfect and they are not together, but they sure as hell love me to death and for that I am grateful. I don’t take enough time appreciating this fact.<br />
Truth be told, I’ve been spending most of my time today praying against this overwhelming exhaustion I feel right now. Too fast, too long, too often, just too much. Everything in my life is one shade of extreme or another. There is little balance and that is, as I’ve convinced myself, just how it is. FALSE! I quoted Matthew 11:28–30 a little while back. What a hypocrite am I? Was that just flowery language? Could it have been a way to show off my “Christian-ness”? May it not be so! If I am truly believing in my freedom in Christ, then why am I still doing this on my own? Why am I still a slave to the clock, money and multiple other vanities? I know all this, but I suffer a common problem stated by Paul in Romans. I lack follow through. I tell myself that my inability to get rest, to overcome pride and false-god worship, is because there is something I can’t put my finger on in between me and God’s power. NO NO NO NO NO! I am in between myself and this great power. It is my lack of faith and pride itself. I am unwilling to let go and let this God who put my parents in my life to mirror his love towards me, who loves me without end, to provide in the doting way that only He knows how. I am unwilling to accept His grace and mercy because I want to earn it. You cannot earn what is priceless. I wish I thought about that fact more often. Obviously, I don’t. I need to, and I need it badly.<br />
So, a good friend asked me if I have ever recorded my music before and I, in my grouchy mood, snapped back, “No.” (I just had to reformat that quote because it’s syntactic incorrectness bothered me) I mean, I would love to. Truthfully, making music for the rest of my life would be my dream job. There is quite possibly nothing on this earth that makes me happier than being around, listening to and making music. However, I am a Computer Science major and I just don’t see much of a way for that to happen. Pardon my lack of vision, but that is simply how I see it.<br />
Now, I have to go to bed, because I agreed to open tomorrow morning on top of my scheduled Monday, Wednesday, Friday openings for my boss.<br />
I’m so excited to be going home this weekend. It’s my mom’s birthday and I get to see her, my sister, dad, aunt, uncle, cousins, and the list goes on…Yes, I really do love my family. They keep me normal. By normal, I mean they keep me from becoming dull =). If a family weren’t crazy, then it simply would be boring and you would be significantly less than normal yourself, as I believe all families are crazy in their own rights. Ok, now I promise I’m going to bed</p>

            <p>As I kinda figured, I’m back once again. So, my professor said after my group’s presentation that our delivery was great however we didn’t actually say anything…harsh. Well, I got stuck in the basement of Olsson Hall for a couple hours and I was able to cement the idea that I have completely lost my mind from the lack of sleep.<br />
I have no idea if what I’m saying right now because I’m strangely asphyxiated by this dumb commercial for this Final Smoke thing that supposedly gets people to stop smoking. I am definitely at my ADD best when I’m completely exhausted as I am right now. I want to keep typing, but my ability to string together coherent sentences is waning to say the least.<br />
So, Brandon Heath. I said I’d pick this topic up in my last post. One of my favorite songs of all time possibly is his “I’m Not Who I Was” simply for the fact that I can relate completely. I don’t think the person I am today much resembles who I was, say a year ago. I could expound on this topic, but it feels too shallow, so there I leave it.<br />
Four cups of coffee is completely wrecking my stomach. I have a delicate stomach as is, but that definitely put me over the edge. Long story short, my tummy is very unhappy.<br />
On another note, I had a pretty sweet dinner with a guy in my project group where we ended up discussing the omnipotence of God. He said how he used to believe in Jesus, but then because he felt insignificant in comparison and that God didn’t really care, he felt that praying was pointless. We talked about how God in his omnipotence cannot be limited and could therefore care for all and every individual all at once. He then went on to say that he thought free will to be a farce, which we then came to the conclusion that, once again, God in His omnipotence could know all our possible choices as well as the possible consequences mapped out and so our free will could appear, from a higher level, as if it weren’t free will at all. I don’t know if this is making any sense as my ability to explain things and be articulate is severely inhibited at the moment.<br />
Ok, now to try to be motivated and hit the gym before bible study…we’ll see how this goes.</p>

            <p>I am not happy right now…it’s 3:00 and I was really looking forward to just sitting back for a few minutes and blogging to my heart’s content. However, I have a lab in 15 minutes where I have to give a presentation on risk mitigation. Here’s risk mitigation for you, don’t make me give this presentation right now and no one gets hurt haha. So, I’m on my fourth cup of coffee and I’m fighting exhaustion desperately. The worst part is that I need to get some real work done on this group project today as it’s crunch time and I don’t have much time in the end of the week, as in zero Thursday on.<br />
On the brighter side of things, going through my bible study for this week I realized that I do not question God’s ability to take care of my needs, but His steadfast devotion to taking care of all my needs. I have allowed my needs to be ignored, forgotten for so long, that I just don’t trust God to truly care about them all the time, just like anyone else. I humanize Him way too much and He is far greater than a mere mortal of any kind. Boo to me.<br />
I have the song “I’m Not Who I Was” by Brandon Heath stuck in my head. Time for lab, so I’ll get to that later I suppose.</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p>As far as I’m concerned, it’s been forever since my last post. Yes, it’s been a weekend and, yes, it is now Monday. It was certainly a long weekend, though I didn’t really do much and it’s been an even longer morning. Aside from doing some group work for this stupid project that I’m rather sick of at this point, going to the gym, going out and sitting around the house in between, the weekend was uneventful. This morning, however was somewhat to the contrary. I got a late start this morning on my quest for Spudnuts before heading to work (normal opening activity), but there was ice on the windshield. I got to the shop and found that the airpots had been moved next to the cash register as opposed to on the countertop behind the register and all the to-go cups were next to the airpots instead of also being on the opposite countertop. This is not a revelation you want to have at 6:45 on a Monday morning, trust me. Then, I remembered we had no bakery goods because of Presidents’ Day, which simply threw me off slightly, but no big deal. Then, I found it very hard to think straight for the majority of my shift, which helped me slowly realize just how tired I am from the weekend. By the way, I’m currently on my third cup of coffee today, not a good sign haha. Back to the story…at about 8:40, I got a decent rush and ran completely out of coffee, had to give this poor girl a coffee rather than the hazelnut latte she had ordered because she simply had no more time to wait, and it was just me behind the counter. Luckily, Greg came around 9:00, so there was some relief, but not before the damage had been done. As far as I was concerned, we had reached crisis mode haha. Then, I ended up leaving work 15 minutes late and when you have 30 to drive back home, grab your belongings for the day and get to class, you can’t recover from that. Even better, when I got back, I realized I was locked out of my own house (long story involving a key breaking off in a lock) and had to stack a couple cinderblocks and shimmy in through a small window in the back. I think at this point it goes without saying that I missed my first class today haha. Now, I’m sitting in my Intro Philosophy class trying not to let my eyes roll back into my head as we discuss Decartes’ Meditation 1 and not trusting the senses. I have to admit, however, I <em>do</em> agree with this distrust.<br />
While the senses are wonderful and I enjoy quite a few of them, they do lie to us. This is why in the Christian life, faith is not a feeling. Our senses, while necessary and good, do not give us the entire story all the time. They are meant to be enjoyed, but when it comes to complete reliance, this is where the line is to be drawn.<br />
Yeah, I really wish I had something deeper, but I haven’t spent any time over the past few days on anything of a spiritual nature, which is entirely a shame.<br />
I’m sure I’ll be back later as I’m going through blogging withdrawal…</p>

            <p>I definitely did not expect to make a second post pretty much ever, but especially not today with how busy today was and how tired I feel right now. Yet, here I am once more.<br />
I may have mentioned that I love music, well today was another example of why. So, I help set up the sound system for Agape as I mentioned earlier today. While the band was practicing and Mike and I were equalizing the sound, it hit me. As much as I don’t like the actual physical setting up process of lugging heavy equipment in and out of cars and setting up all the equipment, I love just hearing the music and watching the band, particularly Brian, just really give their all in the worship. To see them just singing and/or playing their heart out in front of over 100 people energizes me in a way few things can. As tired as I knew I was, I couldn’t help but just be ecstatic and overflowing with joy. This is why I love music.</p>

          <h2><a href="/im-such-a-poser/">i’m such a poser</a></h2>
    
          <div class="entry">
            <p>I’m writing now because I have some spare time in between a meeting and discussion and I honestly don’t know how much energy I’ll have when I return from the evening’s activities. That being said, one more disclaimer. I’m pretty much stealing this topic from a good friend who will probably read this and call me out on it, but it’s all the material I got.<br />
I was definitely tired this morning as I rolled out of bed (crawled frailly, in truth) at 5:30 this morning to pick up the doughnuts and get to work on time. I have to say, waking up is the toughest thing for me on a daily basis. I LOVE sleep. Outside of music and soccer, it’s in a dead heat with food for my next favorite set of activities. I think I’m saying this because I’m really tired right now and wishing there was some relief in sight, however there most certainly is not. I’ll get to that later.<br />
I got a wonderful treat at work today as I had several friends stop by the shop during my uber-early shift from 6:30 to 9:00 before class at 9:30. Well, this one friend of mine, who will remain nameless at least for the moment, came in and was probably the biggest surprise of the morning because I have never seen her in the coffee shop, ever. Anyway, she was with a friend of hers and proceeded to tell her friend about both of our blogging exploits and how I started mine after she started hers, which is completely true. However, this revealed me for the poser I am haha. No, I’m not a complete poser, but in all truth she wasn’t the only friend I have who started a blog in the past month or so and seeing all those new blogs made me feel like I was missing out, so that’s what got me started thinking about this thing we refer to as the “blogoshpere.” I really like that word for some reason, it’s just hard to spit out.<br />
Now, for the truly unoriginal part of my post. In my meeting, which was really a discipleship meeting in all honesty, we talked about “living in the light” and when one is living in the light, they experience fellowship, which to me is friendship in its purest form. There is something about that word that makes me feel like it emphasizes the comradery and mutual investment of the relationship that the word friendship doesn’t capture. This fellowship, until last summer was something I never realized I was truly lacking in my life. It wasn’t until I was thrust into a community of grace and truth, that I realized I had no idea what I had just gotten myself into. I have so contented myself with darkness and hiding because of my fear of disappointing those who mean most to me that I simply didn’t invest in our relationship or allow myself to be transparent and honest with them because I was afraid they wouldn’t like the me they would see. I was alone, lonely and depressed and I hated life. That’s just sad. Life is a wonderful gift. We only have a short time on this earth, and every second, every opportunity wasted is a gift that we have thrown away and can never get back. Despite all that I have discarded, I am continuously given more. It was only when I had real friends that I realized their purpose in this journey that is life. We are all journeyers on this earth and friends keep us company on that journey as well as provide some key guidance at times. Without them I am hopelessly lost. These friendships, fellowships as I prefer, are a huge gift from above that make the trials and tribulations of this broken and fallen world that much more bearable and the good times that much sweeter. Friendship can only make this life a little more rewarding. I know I am not alone in this thought.<br />
So now I’m off to my “non-stop discussion block” which is Philosophy 101 discussion followed by New Testament discussion, then I bolt off to help at Agape with the sound system after which I help run during the meeting. After that, there is the hang out time at the Castle and around 10:30–11 I get back home and get straight to bed to wake up at 5:30 again and do the whole work thing again. Get it son!</p>

            <p>I can’t remember if I posted last night, but I’m far too lazy to check. On second thought, I know I did because I distinctly remember talking about soccer again haha.<br />
Today was kind of a blur. I spent the entire morning and half the afternoon waiting for classes to be over so I could hang out with my Dad for a little and also see an old family friend. I could not say what was gone over in any of my 3 classes, but I do know it wasn’t all that important.<br />
On to the important stuff now. I rushed off to meet my Dad at that grassy area across the street from the Corner, whatever it’s called. Sadly enough, he looked straight at me and didn’t even recognize me…that’s really sad I know. Anyway, we had lunch at Michael’s and had an awesome conversation about how vast and infinite God really is. It was scary because my Dad and I don’t often agree completely on spiritual issues because most of my beliefs have been passed down to me from people in the church who I perceived as more mature than myself as well as misconceptions of those views. I feel like I’ve had those views challenged a lot recently and that’s a good feeling when I can say that this belief that I’m talking about is genuinely my own because I’ve taken that belief and evaluated for myself its validity. Simply put, though, God is too vast for us to ever understand. To know God would mean that we would at the very least have to be equally as powerful and vast as God, but we being finite can never be that vast or powerful. That certainly doesn’t mean we shouldn’t try to understand Him better. In fact, it should spur us on that much more. We just have that much more that we can possibly learn. I don’t know, but that thought kind of excites me. We need to stop taming God and putting Him in a nice, neat box that our minds can comprehend. This God is nothing less than the Creator, warrior, the most powerful being in the universe. For heaven’s sake, He brought the universe into being. I’m kinda thinking that makes him more powerful than the universe, which means I have no clue how powerful He is. Now, that’s an awesome thought.<br />
The funny thing is that this totally goes along with a conversation I had/am having currently online with a friend. God is so much more powerful, vast, awesome, great and amazing than I give Him credit for pretty much ever.<br />
I’m going to leave that there, because I don’t want to ruin that thought. I think it’s just beautiful as is. In a way, it’s comforting and in another, it’s terrifying. Honestly, I don’t fear Him as I should. If He so wished, He could smite me from this earth and banish me to an eternity in Hell without lifting a finger. If that’s not terrifying, I don’t know what is.<br />
Well, I have to work in the morning so I’ll leave this here…</p>

            <p>So, I really want to write something meaningful, but I have the sinking feeling this post will be rather meaningless and simply all over the place. Here goes nothing.<br />
Once again I ran into John today and talked with him for over a half hour before scooting off to class. Greg, who was observing the conversation later shed some light on John that I had noticed today in particular but was unwilling to really unearth. John’s biggest problem is that his spiritual life is all in his head. I can say this because this is my great struggle as well. So many truths do I know in my head, but they do not influence the way in which I act on a daily basis. Essentially, I am an encyclopedia of do’s and don’ts. I am no greater than the Pharisees. Foolish vanity. Were I using this knowledge to make a difference in my life and the life of others, this would then be wisdom. However, it is nothing more than wasted knowledge.<br />
I went to a new bible study tonight through Portico, the church I attend here. It was a great conversation reflecting in community on the sermon from Sunday as well as going over the same material as the bible study i normally attend on Mondays. I think the repetition is good for someone like myself who is a little stubborn. It was good getting to meet some guys who I don’t know or don’t know well. We had some great conversation especially in regards to one line of the sermon in particular where Chris said “We should long for the impossibility of rest outside of Christ.” What an amazing statement. We should dream of the day when we do not wish to find rest outside of that is found in Christ. What a beautiful aspiration.<br />
There are few things that annoy me more than unreliable (at best in this case) internet service, being a CS major. This is simply the beast that is the internet at my house here currently. It makes me realize how much I take for granted the overflow of information that is the web. I want my information and I want it this very instant. It’s like waiting a few seconds is going to kill me or invalidate the web page I am trying to view. Wow, that’s mildly pathetic and upsetting.<br />
So, I thought I had run out of things to say, but apparently not. The last thing I promise is once again SOCCER. Yes, I played some intramural this evening and, yes, was I loving life. It’s strange, but after taking a few months off from playing any soccer whatsoever, I feel much more relaxed while I’m playing. The first five minutes of the game were nearly flawless and I realized that this was just what I needed. I, for the first time in my life, was playing without hesitation or fear. In a breakaway, when normally I would have panicked and kicked the ball straight at the keeper, I was almost thrown off by how calm I felt and neatly tucked the ball away in the right side netting. I have never been able to do that. Then, I had another shot where I merely saw the keeper before shooting and hit it with the outside of my right foot, the hardest surface of the foot to control, and past the keeper it went. I know this was by no skill of my own, because I could do neither of these things in practice before the game and I doubt if I could do them on any consistent basis now. In that time I also set up another goal and nearly had a couple more myself. I don’t mean to brag, it’s just that I absolutely love this game and have to talk about it. It is like golf for me where you have that one shot or that one run or touch that is just world class and the memory of that keeps you coming back in the hopes of duplicating it. The only real difference is that this sport is more like 20–30% physical where golf is maybe 1. I don’t mean to diss golfers, as I enjoy the sport myself, but there is a physical aspect to soccer that is certainly not as prevalent in golf. It is this combination that I love so much. And now it’s sleepy time.</p>

            <p>I feel like an old man. It’s 8:20 and I’m completely exhausted. I will say, it’s been a long day with not getting to bed early last night and working this morning. This idea of rest is seemingly more important and pertinent than I thought.<br />
I’ve lived the past five semesters with the mindset that I could not run myself into the ground, I could go and go without feeling the effects. WRONG! My summer was the epitome of that. On average, and I kid you not, I got an average of 5 hours of sleep a night. On a good night, I got 7 hours, but these were few and far in between. I admit, the ability to function despite that was a true gift from God. I can’t keep that pace any longer. I spent 10 weeks straight at that pace and in some fashion, I tried to carry it on through last semester and into this, but my body is saying enough is enough. I am not God, I need rest. I am finished trying to take on the world as it were. I need sustenance and part of receiving that sustenance is admitting that I need it to carry on any further. Yeah, I think I’ve reached that point. It’s a great thought, taking on the world, but I was doomed from the outset. I’m not exactly stocky to begin with, so I’m at a huge disadvantage haha. No, but seriously, I was never designed to live a life in which I was taking it on single handed. I was made for this divine romance where my salvation and my sustenance are found when I look to the cross. When I view my life and struggles in light of the death and resurrection of Christ, whom I believe to be my Savior, I find strength and refuge. It is when I am able to submit to this benevolent indentured servitude under the kind master, that my life actually resembles just what life was initially meant to look like. In the beginning, the wills of Adam and Eve were free, but their free wills aligned perfectly with God’s. What made God happy made them happy as well as they knew no sin. There was a glorious and holy harmony that existed in the Garden. I believe that in our lives are glimpses of this perfect alignment of wills. In light of Romans 12:2, our wills at that very moment, being aligned with God’s, our will is good, pleasing and perfect. This is only for a split second, but this thought to me is mind-blowing.<br />
I got a text from a friend today who said that John was telling her how genuine a Christian I was. My initial reaction was embarrassment. I’m sure that anyone who knows me knows that I am a common fraud. I do not go out of my way, nor do I put myself out there for this cause. I wanted to run and hide, because I feel that I have led them both astray, John most of all. I am nothing to talk about, let alone veritably rave about here. I have been to John, or tried to be in all honesty, what I perceived John could use, hopefully most. I simply gave him someone to talk to and have spiritual conversation with from time to time. Now I hear he’s going around calling me a genuine Christian and I am afraid that I must disagree with the man, despite how intelligent and perceptive I believe him to be. My secondary reaction, overcome rather soon by the primary was feeling flattered, but again that was short lived.<br />
This may sound strange coming from someone studying computer science as his major, but the world today is simply moving too fast for its own good. Each and every day, I find myself wishing there were more hours in a day. Why do I wish this? It is simply because there is too much that I feel that I need to do each day for it ever to fit in the confines of 18 hours, let alone 24. Everything these days has to move at the speed of light and even that’s becoming too slow for some things. I find myself constantly bombarded with information, news and opinions that I, as Chris said yesterday, am forced to sift through it all to decipher what is valuable and what I should hold onto and what I just need to disregard. This has become the key to a successful day to day existence. There simply isn’t enough time in the day to go through it all, so I am forced to choose what small portion of it that I will actually pay my attention and time in exchange for the information of sorts contained within the various packages, from email to tv to newspapers and the list goes on endlessly. Let’s just slow down and live life at a pace attainable and sustainable by humans, because that’s what we are still, right? I mean, I think I am a human, but I’m expected to live at a pace only attainable by light. Is there a red flag going up here? I am a human and even the fastest can move at maybe 28–29 miles per hour. I am no Olympic sprinter, but for the sake of argument I’ll say that I am. Even being an Olympic sprinter, I can move at less than 1/20,000 the speed of light. Ok, now I know a red flag has to be waving now. We, as a society are driving ourselves into the ground and want to achieve that feat sooner and sooner. Why do we think people get burnt out so fast in life, have midlife crises, or have many other stress and/or mental issues? It’s simple. We are killing ourselves from the pace we try to keep, that we were never meant to live at in the first place. How about just slowing down, resting, relaxing from time to time and possibly, I don’t know, even enjoying life on occasion? There is hope…</p>

<p>“Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.” — Matthew 11:28–30</p>

            <p>So, I completely slept through yesterday. I got back from the scavenger hunt at noon and passed out from 1 to 8:45 last night. That felt phenomenal. I then woke up, ate dinner, and went with my movie buddy, Brandon, and attempted to see He’s Just Not That Into You. I say attempted because when we got halfway through the line, the announcement came that the movie had sold out. Immediately afterward, we overheard the gaggle of ladies in front of us derisively asking how any guys in line could be wanting to see the movie anyway. Brandon immediately announced how excited he was to see Taken. I, following suit, agreed audibly. We got our tickets for Taken and Brandon then accidentally walked into the theater showing He’s Just Not That Into You. I asked him if he had realized his “mistake” and when he asked me which movie I preferred to see, I commented truthfully that I’d rather see the movie playing in the theater into which we had haphazardly walked. In all honesty, it was a great movie.<br />
I was really debating whether or not I was going to Portico this morning having slept through my normal 9am service. I’m still planning on going to “Abide”, the young-20’s service at 5 starting this week. It all came down to me worrying about having enough time during the rest of the day to complete the work that I feel I “need” to do.<br />
So now it’s around 11:30 pm and I have a heck of a lot more to write about now.<br />
Service this morning was certainly awesome talking about the fourth Commandment which focuses on keeping the Sabbath. It was good for me to hear again that I do need to slow this life that moves at the speed of light and just rest once a week. Of course, this is not something that’s possible on my own, but when is that a new thing?<br />
I studied for a little bit after getting a free coffee from Starbucks (yes, I said free) when I ordered a red eye as per my usual and because they didn’t have coffee readily brewed, my drink was free. This was slightly bittersweet as I got a free drink which is never a bad thing, however given that I can only drink either straight espresso, coffee or a red eye, and their coffee is atrocious, it will take longer to go through this gift card. Yes, the fact that I had a gift card was the only reason I didn’t go to Fox Park, the much better coffee place that is open on Sundays. Had it been any other day of the week, I would have been at Para without hesitation.<br />
I studied for an hour or so, when I decided to return to the house so I could take care of a couple things before a group project meeting I had to attend. This was no coincidence as I ran into my friend John on the way back. We ended up talking for over 45 minutes on the Corner about various topics, and I couldn’t help but think even as I was talking to him that the conversation was nothing short of a blessing from God. I love talking to John, because he forces me to explain my points better and articulate my thoughts to a further extent than I am used to and he is a very intelligent man for someone who has never gone to college. I do not feel bad for the man, because he generally has a great outlook on life, but he is certainly self-conscious and for no apparent reason, honestly. What I love most, though, about talking to John is that I feel like he has given me so much more than I could have possibly given him in our conversations. I will admit that I don’t feel like anything I say does him much good, but he assures me otherwise. Therefore, I not only feel good about the effect on my life, but the effect that he insists I have had on his. There are few better feelings on this earth than just that.<br />
I went to the new service after my group meeting and, sure enough, the first person I saw inside the sanctuary was none other than John. Once again, I talked to him for a few minutes as the service was getting ready to begin and he said something that blew me away in a sense and made me feel important in a way that I have never felt important. He thanked me for taking the time to talk to him, for not caring who saw me talking to him, and most of all for taking him under my wing spiritually. Truthfully, this last thought had never once crossed my mind and I wanted to throw the compliment right back in his face, because I thought it was preposterous to think I had any ability to do something like that. It wasn’t until I had thought into and about this statement that I truly was able to appreciate the fact that God is doing something through my relationship with John and I am horribly anxious and excited to find out just what that might be.<br />
The message at church, amazing as it was, paled in comparison to the conversations I had with John today. I have to say, the Lord has been absolutely amazing as of late with the things he has been showing me. Some of these things, I had no clue were an issue in my life, but all of them lead to a greater sense of joy in knowing that God cares enough about me to remove them from between us. He is nothing short of absolutely amazing.<br />
I was just about to quit typing, but then I realized that I almost forgot a significant part of my day which happened right after my second stint in church. I had told my good friend Nicole that I would accompany her to some house party for some thing that she told me about whose details I simply can’t remember, but she said she didn’t want to go alone, so I obliged. What I didn’t realize or pay attention to until she sent me the email today was that this party was actually a house concert. I assumed it would be some outdoor event in someone’s backyard where it would be mildly awkward, but everyone would be looking at the performer so as not to force god-awful conversations. No. After picking Nicole up at her house, getting lost in the woods on a wonderfully curvy road (wonderful because we were in my car with the top down and romantically enough a full moon to boot [Nicole and I are not in the least involved in any sense of the word, but we both saw the full moon as ironically funny as she commented how she wished she could have seen it with any guy other than me clearly denoting me as a safe guy in her books]) and finding the house (no, I’m not going into the back story on Nicole and myself, because that is simply too long and just unnecessary to delve into) we walked inside to find the guy setting up in the living room. This was fixing to be a very different experience for me. They were serving hors d’oeuvres and beer and wine and people from about 20 to maybe 50-somethings were all conversing about the first floor of this nice ruralite home. Long story short, the guy was an amazing guitarist and vocalist and I am dying to own some of his music. Yes, I promise this guy, Tom Conlon, was just that good. I don’t lie about music. The only problem I had with his performance, was that I felt much less certain about my own musical ability. At the moment, I question whether I have much of any haha. Well, I’m off. I have to work in the morning. What a beautiful, blessed life I lead =).</p>

            <p>Can we please get over Michael Phelps? For heaven’s sake, it seems like the only stories news and sports channels (i.e., ESPN) actually care about is the photo with his mouth on a (presumably) marijuana bong. Whoop-de-freaking-do. I’m sorry, but marijuana use is not such a rare thing in either the sports or college world. Yes he screwed up and the photo should never have been taken, but who really cares?! If he were any regular citizen, no one would give a flying flip! Really, America? Let’s have some class and grace here.<br />
After my rant, I’m seriously stoked for this all night scavenger hunt encompassing Virginia, Maryland and West Virginia. Yeah, it’s just that epic. If I don’t write for a few days, don’t worry I was probably just arrested for trespassing somewhere haha. So, I’m pretty much writing off tomorrow as I’m going to be recovering from the absolute lack of sleep, but I can’t complain given the prospects.<br />
Once again, I love music. It hit me today as I was playing for Agape’s prayer this afternoon and I became aware of just how happy it makes me to worship especially through playing and singing. I was pretty much in a state of euphoria during those three songs.<br />
I wish I had more time during the day, because I always feel like there is so much I want to do. However, I just rarely ever have time to do it all.<br />
I got lunch with a friend today at O-Hill, I once again was reminded why I dislike the dining halls in general, and we focused on the topic of taking to heart God’s love and grace. It’s easy to remember Him when we’re in dire straights and can find no way out of the situation, but what about the less than tough times? So often do I find myself trying to take on the world when I feel like the hurdles are more my size. I need to realize that I need help just as much then as I do when I feel the weight of the world bearing down on me. Oh, how short a memory do I have.</p>

            <p>I want to write something profound, something that when I reread it, would put a smile on my face and I would know that it was worthwhile. Too bad I cannot do that on command. Honestly, I am not that great a writer. My goal here is not to be as eloquent as possible, but to simply put forth what I am contemplating and some other of my random thoughts.<br />
Once again, I’m writing when I should probably be going to bed as I’m already tired and need to be at work at 6:30, but here I am still.<br />
Thursdays are definitely my long day of the week as classes start at 9:30, at 12:15 I get lunch, I have a meeting at 2:15, two discussions at 4 and 5, then I help set up the sound system for Agape and finally I help work the sound system during the meeting. Since I got up early this morning to do some reading before class, I was out of the house from about 8:15 to 10:30…yes, it’s been a long day, but I love 6:00. At that moment my weekend begins and everything I do from then on in the week is nothing but fun. I love music. I love listening to it, playing it, creating it, I love analyzing it. Seriously, I love everything about music, so the work with the sound system is nothing but enjoyment for me.<br />
I had a meeting today and the conversation came to the topic of God’s gift of salvation. I wanted very strongly to just tune out because I, being terribly pridefully, thought there was nothing there for me to learn. I’m thankful that I didn’t actually tune out, because something was brought up that really gave me a new outlook and appreciation for this free gift we refer to as salvation. When we choose to receive this beautiful free gift, not only are all of our transgressions forgiven and forgotten, but we are also counted as righteous. It’s like our bank account being in the red and then this benevolent stranger goes and wipes away all your debt, but then he also gives you a billion dollars on top of all that. Honestly, the thought that I could be righteous is mind-blowing. I’m thinking, does God really know what I’ve done in my life to date? I know better, though. The beautiful thing is that in spite of all the times I have betrayed His perfect love, He knows each and every one and forgives me day after day and still calls me blameless. He sees beyond all the things that I have done to dirty the perfectly clean life He has given me and counts me as perfect. The word “righteous” continues to ring in my head, because it seems almost too amazing and poetic to be true. I want to believe it, but it’s almost beyond my imagination.<br />
I was going to make some comment about the cold weather, but the combination of having Good Will Hunting in the background and it being a little late, completely derailed that train of thought. I want to go to Boston in the summer. I’ve been there in the winter and I admittedly enjoyed it. I think that I would enjoy it even more in the late spring or summer months.<br />
I miss last summer and the thought that I will never have another summer like it is terribly saddening, but at the same time it makes me all the more grateful for the 11 weeks I spent with the people I came to know and love in possibly my favorite place in this entire hemisphere.<br />
Ok, it’s now time I go to sleep…I’m kinda looking forward to work in the morning, because other than the actual waking up, I do love my work and my job.</p>

          <div class="entry">
            <p>I really should be doing some of the reading I’ve been backlogging all week, but I’m finding it nearly impossible. As usual I’m sitting in Para despite the fact that I opened this morning and I’m just sitting here kind of observing what’s going on around me. There is a great mixture of conversations from a discussion about ministry to an upcoming art exhibit to a discussion about classes and profession. I just got a little distracted as I related the events of work this morning to a coworker and friend. Long story short, I was working alone as is usual before 9am and I got this insane rush of customers where I ran out of coffee completely and had a drink queue of about 8 espresso drinks and was stuck at the register because customers just kept coming in the store and finally the “management team” came in to help my predicament. As hectic as that was, I would not change a thing about my job.<br />
Ok, so I have now completely lost my train of thought. I love friends though. They are the best cure for most every ailment of happiness. I use this because there is nothing that brightens my day like seeing a good friend and having a conversation with them and really seeing how they are doing. Not only have I just seen a friendly face, but in most cases I have also gotten a warm hug, a genuine smile and a true opportunity to pray for someone about whom you deeply care. Whether either of you notice it or not, you have just been given the opportunity to make an eternal difference in that person’s life. I love feeling like I am helping people, so this is particularly appealing to me.<br />
I feel a little ADD at the moment because I’m now turning my attention to the issue of sin and our turning from the God of Love. Sin is not denying God’s love, though on one level it is, and it is not simply disobeying Him, though it is that as well, but it is so much more and deeper than both of those. Our sin is an arrogant betrayal of God’s love. Sin goes so much deeper than the surface of knowledge and action down to the very heart where the crux of the issue lies. Sin is a heart condition denying the very heart of God. However, God has made the appropriate countermeasure in something that we may appreciate, but I believe I will never fully understand. God gives us grace to cover up the betrayal and renew the relationship He is actively pursuing. He is the perfect husband relentlessly seeking His perfect bride who is consistently running from Him. The very bride He made perfect, and I act as if I can be perfect without Him. It’s something like Pepe Le Peu and I am the cat always running from Pepe’s incessant love and attempts to woo me. No matter what I do, I can neither lose His love, nor escape Him. If I truly believe Him to be as I’ve described, why in the hell would I want to, though? It seems completely preposterous and nonsensical.<br />
I don’t know where that warm weather we had Sunday and Monday went, but it can return again. I’m kinda over the whole cold thing by now. I’ve seen my snow here, we can move on. Ahh…I guess I will have to wait a few weeks more for Spring Break in the Caribbean (yes, I’m rubbing it in).<br />

          <div class="entry">
            <p>So, I’ll keep this short as I have to be up in about 6 1/2 hours for work, but I did want to jot a quick thought down as today was certainly an interesting and wonderful day in its own right. For about the first time ever (well, maybe just this semester but whatever) I got up early this morning and did some reading for the class I had at 11:00 which was somewhat phenomenal. Then I went to my classes and ate a solitary sushi lunch as usual and did some reading for New Testament which I’m happy I get to take this semester for no reason other than I want to =P. That was pretty sweet along with nailing down a time to work on a group project I have and then continuing to read the Gospel of Matthew in Para (I need to find a real home haha) and had a wonderful conversation about the humor and nature of God and how everything works for His purpose with a good friend. I said hi to some other friends and left to get ready for probably the highlight of my week…ok, so I think really Monday’s Bible study was the true highlight but just go with it. I played some indoor soccer and I remember why I’m thankful for that blessed sport. It was the second time I’d touched a soccer ball this week and it felt transcendental. Soccer is the only time you will ever see me openly aggressive, yet I am still calm and collected which is something that I find I don’t care to understand. Soccer is the greatest outlet for me because it combines both physical exertion along with the mental strain of calculating every move, every pass, every step and frankly, I’m good at that. Throw in a little electric jam session and you have the makings of a stupendous day, but it got better. After the game a few of us decided to hit up Chipotle…enough said. I have to admit I’m nearly exhausted after then being locked in the dungeon of Olsson, the Mecca of engineering CS students, for nearly 3 hours. It’s been a good day.<br />
Honestly, here is my problem with the day. What did I do for anyone other than myself? Where is the importance if all I did was to indulge in happiness and bliss for myself? This is where I’m struggling here. I have spent the past 2 1/2 years doing nothing but what I wanted to do and keeping to myself however there are about 13,000 other undergraduate students alone here alone, not to mention staff, faculty and grad students. There is a greater purpose to which I have put the blinders on my eyes. I know I don’t have to solve world hunger, poverty or peace, but I believe doing something for someone other than solely myself would be a start.<br />
In the story of life, I have to realize that I am but a supporting actor in the play written by and starring God. I’m following my own script, writing my own lines, but to what end? I accomplish nothing. According to King Solomon, all things under the sun are but vanity, yet I seek happiness and personal contentment. I do not say that when I am doing things motivated by God that I must be miserable, but happiness must not be a primary concern as it is now. I have to be willing to suffer for the cause for which I claim to have sacrificed my life. I still hold onto that life as if its meaningless is priceless. No, that wasn’t supposed to make sense, because it doesn’t. Let’s face it, I am incapable of living a life worthy of anything if left to my own devices. I am simply not that capable as I was not designed to be. I, like everyone else, was made to live in communion with the Great Creator who seeks after me with a passion that is unparalleled anywhere. Even though I know this, I still turn away from Him and try to survive and even thrive on my own, but it is all in vain.<br />

            <p>And it’s Monday, but not a typical one. Thank the Lord for good moods and His grace. For whatever reason, it probably had something to do with the Bible study prep material that I was doing while working, I was in the best mood leaving work. This Study, strangely and providentially, follows the material of Sunday’s sermon and subsequent quiet time almost perfectly.<br />
There is so much about God and the Christian lifestyle that I have gotten so screwed up in my head that it’s a little scary, honestly. In his book Emotionally Healthy Spirituality, Peter Scazzero I think points out something often overlooked, something that I have certainly missed. He points out that the way we view spirituality and God has a lot to do with how we were raised and our family background. I view God in light of always trying to appease my parents, seeking approval and affirmation, therefore I feel that I must “perform” to please God. I do not see Him as accepting me regardless and not becoming disappointed in me when I do the wrong thing. I am so afraid to screw up in my spiritual walk that it looks more like an infant’s crawl. It’s rather pathetic I will admit. I am so paralyzed by this fear that there is no hope of me espousing the true lifestyle I am called to lead. I am to be loving RECKLESSLY, which I realize carries a negative connotation. However, by reckless I mean that if I am truly filled with the Spirit of the God whom I claim to worship with my whole heart, then by God being love, I should be filled with love and overflowing that showering it on all with whom I come into contact. I don’t. That really is the long and short of the state of my heart. I keep it guarded as I will admit I’ve been hurt brutally in the past. I don’t wish to blame those who hurt me as hurt is a natural part of life that is necessary so that we may learn to love more wisely, but nonetheless as the word suggests it does create pain. I have and continue to put my faith in things that were never meant to have that faith, but there God is on the sidelines, in a sense, where I put Him waiting for me to return to the only true love I have ever known. Sure, my parents love me but the love which comes from them is very different. I can keep secrets from my parents, whereas I cannot do the same with God. There is a part of me that wants to question if my parents would still love me the way they do if they knew all that I had done, but I know that situation does not exist with God, because there is nothing I could even attempt to hide from Him. I have to say that this is an incredibly scary thought, but after reading through that Bible study, I feel like it’s been pretty well confirmed that He loves me still. What have I done to deserve it? I think the answer to this question is the most reassuring and uplifting in all of life’s questions. He loved me so much before I was ever conceived that He sent His Son to be a sacrifice so that He could share an eternity with me. I am worth just that much to Him. I don’t know about you, but I cannot put a price on that.<br />
Totally unrelated, the Super Bowl last night…I have to say the better team won, but the Cardinals put up an impressive fight. The commercials for the most part were sub-par. Strange enough, I got more enjoyment from the game than I did the commercials as a whole. Oh, and I’m not even going to get started on the car commercials…<br />
Well, it’s class time so that would be my queue to leave I guess =/</p>

            <p>It’s not yet noon and it’s been a deep day already. Between Chris’s message of the third of the Ten Commandments, John Eldredge’s The Ransomed Heart and God’s putting the two together a little bit, just enough to both reveal Truth to me and perplex me, I feel slightly overwhelmed. I have to say this is probably the best kind of overwhelming I can imagine. My philosophy class right now comes to mind and Socrates in The Apology when he says that he has human wisdom which is the recognition that he knows nothing and that earthly knowledge is worthless in the heavenly realm. That is definitely how I feel right now. So much has just been revealed to me, but in that revelation came the recognition that what has just been revealed will take a lifetime to truly understand and my understanding of what is true wisdom and knowledge is smaller than the smallest star in comparison to the size of the universe. We are made in the image of God, but what is that image? It can’t be our faces or our hands or any physical attribute because we are all made so differently. I feel that what that really refers to is our hearts in that if it is the essence of who we are and were made to be, it is good and contains our deepest needs, desires and passions. God has a heart, too. If God is who He says He is, then is His heart not good and loving? If God’s will is perfect, good and pleasing, then does that not also describe His heart if His will is truly an expression of His heart and who He is? On a day to day basis, I forget this consistently. I do not trust in Him because I can’t come to see Him in this light. As Chris said this morning, that is a form of taking the name of the Lord in vain. I am not believing all that He claims to be and is.<br />
You see? It’s been a heavy morning, but now it is afternoon. That really has nothing to do with anything, but I guess I was just making sure that people realize I’m not a doofus and don’t recognize that this will be posted after 12:00pm.<br />
So, after that horrible tangent, it’s Super Bowl Sunday and I have no real desire to watch the game itself. All I care to see are the commercials (is or are?).<br />
I will go ahead and admit this right now, I’ve been listening to Brooke Fraser since I got here to Fox Park (thank God I can get some DECENT coffee on Sunday) and if I had to marry someone based on her lyrical ability, despite common belief for those who know me, I’d pick Brooke over Taylor. Here’s my thinking, if I were to marry Taylor, then a) she probably would no longer have a career and b) I’d be worried all the time that each new song she wrote was about something I did wrong or that everything I did wrong would lead to her writing a new song. This would not be good in any sense. So, there, I’ve said it haha.<br />
Alright, I should be getting to the work and reading that I have, but I might be back later…</p>

            <p>Well, I realize this is no surprise to anyone but the economy sucks. Honestly, that fact doesn’t really bother me. I think we as a country need it. We have become so arrogant, complacent and pompous that it’s about time we face our own mortality in a sense. I am not completely heartless and apathetic as seeing so many people unemployed truly does break my heart as one of my chief concerns oftentimes is the well-being of others. Despite this natural tendency, I see that our nation is being brought to its knees so that at least some in the nation of excesses and prosperity may see the God of All as the true provider in their lives and in this world. Being in school, I am sheltered in a big way from what is going on economically which is both a blessing and a curse. Of course it is always more comfortable not to go through such a trial as this, but for someone who desires to empathize with others and wishes to help those that are suffering right now, it feels slightly debilitating.</p>

            <p>I firmly believe a blog to be a free-form stream of consciousness so that is how I will write. Honestly, I’ve been pretty adamantly against starting a blog for the simple reason that I don’t really want to think about my life as something so important that several people should and need to care about it. I don’t diminish my inborn significance and worth, but I just err on the side of downplaying it for the simple reason that I was brought up to never boast. It feels great to have a computer once again as in my…wayward attempt to update my hard drive, I realized the process was a lot more involved than I had originally thought.
So, as I sit here on the couch in my living room with Reign Over Me in the background (sort of), Kyle’s cutting Michael’s hair in the foyer and Ross is finally eating dinner, I try to concentrate on what it was that I had intended on saying but it seems to escape me.
The cliche that life is a journey is entirely true I feel in my experiences especially as of lately. Looking at the first few weeks of the semester, my life has been anything but ordinary and boring and I cannot say that I would wish to change that fact. Between salmonella poisoning, working at Para a few mornings each week, conversations with an incredibly interesting man named John, the classes I’m taking this semester, my computer odyssey, and the other numerous things that have gone on, I lead a life full of surprises and countless blessings.
Speaking of blessings, that is something that I grossly overlook all too often. There is so little in my life that is not so much more than I could ever have hoped for or imagined and yet I find plenty of things to complain about on a daily basis.
I think if I had the energy, I could continue writing forever. I find this strangely therapeutic and enjoyable. I wish I had this kind of passion and dedication in my spiritual life. By calling I am a Christian, however I find that so often I am just the opposite in practice. It’s frustrating, it’s annoying and most of all it’s embarrassing. I am a fraud. I frequently do what I hate. I embrace my pride and become self-absorbed, unloving of others which is exactly the opposite of what I claim to believe in my heart. Oh, the heart. I realized I have a very distorted view of the heart. I was given a heart of pure love and caring that is capable of perfectly logical and beautiful thought. The heart is what we were given to commune with our Great Creator, yet I have spent my entire life polluting that beautiful entity and ruining a gift that I could never hope to restore myself. My greatest vessel of love and understanding of the divine and I do not care enough to seek that which is, to borrow a term from philosophy, greater than human. While I cannot hope to attain that which is greater than human, the great pursuit and the Christian journey is a beautiful friendship with the very perfection that we look toward and seek.
Well, I need to go play some music, but I think I will be back at this soon.</p>
