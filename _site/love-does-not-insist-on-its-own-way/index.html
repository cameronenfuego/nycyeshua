    <p><em>Love does not insist on its own way</em>. So far in this weekly series on love, we’ve found it to be <a href="http://104.193.143.57/~waywar13/ce/2012/01/12/love-is-patient/" title="Love Is Patient">patient</a> and <a href="http://104.193.143.57/~waywar13/ce/2012/01/19/love-is-kind/" title="Love Is Kind">kind</a>, but <a href="http://104.193.143.57/~waywar13/ce/2012/01/26/love-does-not-envy/" title="Love Does Not Envy">not envious</a>, <a href="http://104.193.143.57/~waywar13/ce/2012/02/02/love-does-not-boast/" title="Love Does Not Boast">boastful</a>, <a href="http://104.193.143.57/~waywar13/ce/2012/02/09/love-is-not-arrogant/" title="Love Is Not Arrogant">arrogant</a> or <a href="http://104.193.143.57/~waywar13/ce/2012/02/16/love-is-not-rude/" title="Love Is Not Rude">rude</a>. Each week has stretched my understanding as I hope it has for you. I think as with each week, the topic seems simple enough. Love doesn’t insist on its own way. It’s straightforward; an open and shut case. Yes, but really no. There is a right way and a wrong way to love as I hope we’ve established by now, but this time we aim a little bigger with our sights.</p>

<p><strong>Love isn’t one size fits all.</strong> We’ve all grown up learning to love everyone and treat everyone equally. I could not agree with this more, but we’ve taken this a step too far. We all look different, act differently, think differently and carry on our relationships with God differently, correct? Then, it’s safe to say that we are all different physically, mentally, emotionally, spiritually and love sets out to care for each of these dynamics of our beings. With that in mind, how can we try to love everyone in the same way, as in with the same tactics and methodology? It’s like taking a mandolin to a metal concert. Sure, you can play it well, but it is far from applying and it just sounds terrible. This is a major problem. We wonder why people in the Church are leaving or maladjusted. Sure, we’re loving on the person, but they are not being loved in their innermost being. Is it really caring for the person, or is it plain ignorance?</p>

<p>There’s not much here to say. It’s plain and simple: we’re not loving people the way they deserve and need to be loved. It’s time we stopped and took a moment to understand our friends, loved ones and neighbors. It’s time we got to know who the people around us truly are and give them the kind of love that Jesus so freely grants us, a love that meets us where we are. But first, we need to treat everyone equally and decide to love them right. It is a war, especially when love doesn’t insist on its own way.</p>
