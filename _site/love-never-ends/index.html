  <h1 >love never ends</h1>

  <div class="entry">
    <p><strong>Love never ends.</strong> Who knew I could have such trouble with three words. Experience certainly doesn’t confirm this assertion of love. No, my experience mostly denies this. When couples all around us are separating, divorcing, it’s hard to fathom that love doesn’t have a threshold or an expiration.</p>

<p><strong>This is why we love old couples.</strong> Deep down I think we all realize the truth about love and seeing old couples reminds us of that knowledge. I haven’t met a single person who thinks ill of old couples. Likewise, I haven’t met a person who’s met my grandparents and thought anything less than they were “the cutest thing ever.” I’d have to agree. They are one of the few examples that fortifies my faith in this aspect.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Beloved, let us love one another, for love is from God, and whoever loves has been born of God and knows God. Anyone who does not love does not know God, because God is love. In this the love of God was made manifest among us, that God sent his only Son into the world, so that we might live through him. In this is love, not that we have loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins. Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another. No one has ever seen God; if we love one another, God abides in us and his love is perfected in us.” — I John 4:7–12</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Love is from God.</strong> God is love and He is its origin. Therefore, love by association cannot die. If God is love and love ends, then God must change, but this is impossible for an immutable God. Based on its origin, we can’t only have so much love to give as has been said many times before. God sent Love down two milennia ago and Love is still very active in the world today. If you claim to love and it’s not a love perfected, then it isn’t love at all.</p>

<p><strong>God’s love is perfected in us.</strong> I read this verse and it brought me to tears. God sent His Son so that we might live through the Son and in so doing, God’s love becomes perfected in us. The implications of this I cannot comprehend. This statement alone makes love’s unending nature impossible to grasp. Suffice it to say, love perfected knows no bounds. I want to be overwhelmed, however what’s impressed upon me is the possibilities of this love are infinite. If this doesn’t excite you, then I’m not sure what to say.</p>

<p>It’s easy to think that we are the pallbearers of love, carrying in vain it’s heavy casket, but this couldn’t be any further from the truth. Love showed on the third day what it’s trying to tell us today. We know in our hearts love isn’t dead and will never die as there is nothing on this earth that can overcome it. This is because love is from God. Love is from the God that is love and doesn’t change, therefore neither will that which describes Him. That love is then perfected in us when we accept the sacrifice of His Son and willingly submit our lives to His perfect love. In other words, we take part in God Himself in this glorious exchange. Dear friend, lift your eyes and press on because <em>love never ends</em>. Or, tell me, does it?</p>
