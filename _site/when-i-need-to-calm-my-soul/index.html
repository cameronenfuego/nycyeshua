I feel like my heart has been clamoring for peace over the past couple weeks. Work’s been a crazy-maker as of late, I haven’t been sleeping well, and I’m still trying to find a place of sorts in the new-ish surroundings. Needless to say, I need something to calm my soul right about now. I need something to remind me more consistently of the peace that is available to me throughout the day (and night). And I think this song, the way I connect with it right now, is helping toward that end. So is this passage:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Lord reigns; he is robed in majesty; the Lord is robed; he has put on strength as his belt. Yes, the world is established; it shall never be moved. Your throne is established from of old; you are from everlasting. The floods have lifted up, O Lord, the floods have lifted up their voice; the floods lift up their roaring. Mightier than the thunders of many waters, mightier than the waves of the sea, the Lord on high is mighty! Your decrees are very trustworthy;<br />
holiness befits your house, O Lord, forevermore.<br />
- <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=psalm%2093&amp;version=ESV">Psalm 93</a></p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="he-will-calm-mysoul">He will calm my soul</h4>

<p>The God that is just as in control yesterday as He is today and will always be will indeed calm my soul. He is more than strong enough to do so. He’s more than loving enough to bring peace to calamity. He is mightier than the tempest in my heart. The flood waters in which my soul some days feels it is drowning are but ripples to Him. Yes, Him, He will calm my soul.</p>

<p>No, I’m not at peace as I write this. No, I read this before bed last night and still tossed and turned. Things are not OK right here and now, but I know they are on the upswing. I have more than a hollow hope that God will soon calm my soul. In fact, I know that God is answering that prayer as I type. He is putting out the fires, taming the seas, quelling those fears. He is showing me once again that He is good, He is love, and He is full of a kind of grace I may never understand. Friend, do you find yourself in a similar place this morning? Ask and He is big enough to calm your soul, too.</p>
