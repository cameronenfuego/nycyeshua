That’s an amusing thought. I wish I knew what I was writing before I started these posts but I never do. Honestly, I feel like I owe you and myself honesty. I’ve paid a price for that honesty in terms of losing potential partners because my shit is <em>‌too</em> out there. So be it.<!--more-->
This actually feels almost too vulnerable but I’ve been confronting the part of my shadow that I’ve identified as satan in the past couple of weeks. I honestly view this part of me as the devil and have worked hard to split them off from my personality. However, they rear their “ugly” head time to time and I find myself ashamed and feeling guilty. I know that this isn’t how existence is to be.
There are parts of me that aren’t flattering. Many. I would love to bury them and keep them underground to save face but I choose again and again otherwise. I’m at least as human as you, friend.
I don’t consider humans to be intrinsically flawed. This is a departure from my evangelical upbringing. I consider us all to be simultaneously divine and human—fallible and part of the perfection which binds together all creation. And I finally went back to seminary!
For those that don’t know, I grew up evangelical. I left that tradition six years ago. It was both one of the most liberating and painful experiences I can recall. Fuck.
At the time, I was married—to a woman I’d met in the church in the same bible study. We quickly established that we couldn’t communicate and didn’t have the resources to establish that communication so we divorced in four years—one was spent separated communicating through lawyers and email, so more like three.
I’ve been particularly dark in evaluating myself the past few posts. Honestly, that’s easiest for me—being less than generous in my self-evaluation. That poor self-image has led at least a couple of people away from romantic interest.
No, this post isn’t to convince people to date me; fuck that. I take personally, yes, when people use my writing as a means to disconnect from me. It hurts. Deeply.
Today is a new day. I’m merely human, which means that I fuck up some things and do others really well! I’m not merely garbage or satan.
I had a vision the other day where satan surprised me and I envisioned myself as him. I realized that I envisioned myself as him and found this conceptualization easier than confronting the closed off part of myself. My work was cut out for me.
It was terrifying, this satan character inserting himself into my consciousness. Fuck. He snuck in just beyond my vision. I saw that he was the parts of me that I identify as masculine and I’ve kept underground, therefore they’ve become toxic. This part of me received a sincere apology.
I’m so sorry, I said to myself. They deserved at least that. I had let them down and I needed to apologize and ask forgiveness.
This being said, I am convinced that I’m a fraud, an imposter. I’m not brand new and I’m also not a stalwart in my field. I think this syndrome finds us all when we are doing work that aligns with our sense of purpose.
Let’s fucking go, friends. Be you and I’ll be me. Also, let me know if there’s anything you want me to talk about that I haven’t yet. We’re in this together. Be well.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m laughing contemplating about what I might talk in this entry. That’s an amusing thought.

I feel both a fraud and vulnerable to say that I’m scared to acknowledge that I’m terribly afraid of hurting people which leads to them abandoning me—confirming that I am indeed unworthy of love and relationship at all. Those words sting to type because of their truth and sheer weight.<!--more-->
I prefer to protect myself from this seemingly inevitable outcome—and others, by extension—by keeping the monster inside hidden. For deep down, I’m convinced still that I am a monster.I am merely the sum of the worst things that I have ever done in my life. That feels like a pretty beastly, large monster by my recollection.
When I was about four, my dad taught me that relationships were like bank accounts. Lying, meanness, and bad things withdrew from the account which was apparently measured in trust. Only time and the absence of said withdrawals could deposit into the account. However, I never learned when relationships were in the proverbial black—<em>not</em> overdrawn.
Shame on me for continuing to carry around the crushing weight of this view of relationships. That’s where some of my most important work lies today—deconstructing the vestiges of this perverted view and constructing something more imaginative, human. So I hide, I lie, about who I see myself to be at my core. That person is destined for overdrawn relationship bank accounts, nothing more.
I carry around this heartbroken four-year-old for over thirty years. Cries for help, love, security—recognizing their basic humanity—I could not be bothered to attend. <em>This</em>, this is the monster inside, the internalized cry-it-out-model adult who raised me. I don’t blame the adults who raised me as this was the prevailing mode of parenting at the time, but I do mourn the time I have spent clinging onto this implicit message that this child should continue to cry it out until I’m dead and the time we could have had together.
Growing up learning that any “sin” was evidence I was destined for hell in a household that trended toward authoritarianism, I learned to lie. Always lie when I was caught doing something “bad” and lie even more when I was caught lying. Supposedly, consequences were worse for those who lied but I never noticed the difference between the two—do anything bad, get punished.
Confusingly, consequences were different for my sister. She could cry, say she was sorry, and sentences would be erased or at least significantly reduced. I tried this and wound up feeling punished more by the cold, incongruent response to what I’d observed of my sister.
In my adulthood, I became defensive when others pointed out my flaws. I default to this today at times. I was reminded of this just a few days ago. Remnants of that child who was mortally terrified all the time.
However, this time I’ve been able to see this part closer to real time. I’m better able to offer them compassion and understanding. Instead of suppressing the reaction and burying them further, I’m able to begin bringing this part out of the shadows of exile—towards responsibility and wholeness.
I want to be seen as an authentic person, but when it comes down to it I <em>need</em> to be seen as <em>looking like</em> an authentic person. I have my work cut out for me in owning the authentic me, much less presenting that to the world. Part of the challenge here is that I’ve revealed my authentic self to others only after presenting the façade and I’ve felt like they rejected the authentic self was rejected when the dissonance, the lie, what what others rejected.
I’m grateful for my coach and mentor who taught me that the façade is nothing less than a lie. Making myself small out of self-preservation, while perhaps well intentioned, does not serve anyone—particularly myself when the other person learns the truth and my worst fears are again realized. I can’t tell you the amount of pain I have needlessly caused myself repeating this pattern; yet, this pain, the pain I have caused myself and not others, has been necessary to get to this point. The pain I’ve caused others, well, that’s been unnecessary and I do regret it.
I recall playing lacrosse in fourth grade. I was a small kid for that age—I mean arguably the smallest on the team. The first few practices, I got the shit kicked out of me unequivocally.
Since I can remember, I’ve received messages that I wasn’t though enough. However, this was different as I was finally able to rise to the challenge. By mid season, I was one of the three hardest hitting kids on the team.
What I learned was that this world was dominate or be dominated. This was one of the most detrimental lessons I have ever had to unlearn. It fucks me up today. This sad and inhumane viewpoint that predominantly runs the society in which we live.
Dominate the narrative of who I am or the world will dominate and I will necessarily become some awful, evil person. There were other effects, yes, but I’ll save those for another post. Where I’ll focus today is in the realm of appearance and reputation.
In the last couple of years, I’ve put myself in situations because of this lying where my reputation has been torn to shreds. I tried to be someone I’m not for a couple of people, couldn’t maintain the charade, and as a last-ditch effort torpedoed both relationships to get myself out of the situation as cleanly as possible. Both breakups became more public as acquaintances and friends eventually learned of the events, and I lost a lot of people I had considered my community.
I fucked up. Massively. That’s what happens. However, what made these incidents different for me from the past was that I didn’t leap into defense of my perceived character; I didn’t try to defend the façade. I made a different mistake and chose to simply clam up, instead of acknowledging my faults and mistakes.
I see better today how this wasn’t a better approach, merely a different one. This approach was merely a different coat of paint on the original problem—I can bury the parts of me that feel unlovable by not talking about them, especially after I’ve fucked up and that is now public. In relationships, I understand, both parties have some responsibility and I can only claim mine.
In the last few days, I’ve realized that I can be honest about what has happened to me or I can be honest about who I am; I cannot do both. The latter scares me as I’ve shared here. Yet, I know the only gift I have to give this world is who I am. Thus, I cannot be an indirect object of existence.
You and I must be subjects within the story, viscerally human. I must learn to be fallible and not mistake that for purely evil. My goal is not to be some divine being sent to earth but a human radically comfortable with the totality of my humanity.
I got caught up in my younger years believing that my aim was divinity but I think that the great teachers came to teach us to embrace fully our humanity so that we might transcend lying about ourselves to save face. Perhaps they were trying to show us that authenticity and transparency about our humanity—the profane—was the only path to enlightenment or divinity.
So I leave you today a work in progress. As I’ve told you, I have my work cut out for me. I know that we’re doing the best we can, you and I, and some days it feels like it’s one step forward and two steps back. However, maybe every step is our unique step forward.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s odd to admit that my greatest fear has to do with relationships given what I do professionally.

Sure, these days I look more like Jesus of the bible. However, I’m much more apt to believe myself—particularly in intimate relationships—to be a satan than a savior. Romantically speaking, I can say with confidence that most of my exes see me as the former. I can be whatever you prefer; yet, this has very little to do with the proverbial you I believe.<!--more--></p>

<p>I’ve done an amount of reflecting this long weekend, and previously, and I know I’ve fucked up a lot—I won’t deny that fact. That’s something I need to and can own at this point; I’ve fucked up a lot. However, I also know that I introject, which means that I take the expressed ideas and thoughts of others and metabolize them as my understanding of who I truly am. Statements that people have made at raw, vulnerable moments I have accepted of myself as unquestionably true.</p>

<p>In intimate relationships—and friendships—I’ve fawned or bent myself into a small enough shape where I don’t have needs and negative events don’t proportionately affect me. I have a tendency of manipulation where I deny my needs in relationships—of all kinds—and trying to get those needs met met when situations inevitably arise.</p>

<p>Functionally, I assume that if I have needs, I’m human, or show signs of vulnerability—weakness, as I learned—I will hurt and deeply. Friends and intimate relationships will leave me eventually, I understand. Human relationships are still difficult for me to understand. No matter how long the relationship, I understand that relationships end.</p>

<p>Relationships ending is my starting point. I do whatever I can in a desperate attempt, still, to avoid and stay that end. I’m heartbroken again and again when I usher relationships to their tragic ends. And I perform this act again and again.</p>

<p>I’m afraid—in all honesty—to write this knowing that it will come off to some as purely narcissistic. Early in the separation before my divorce, my ex-wife was reading books about narcissism. Between the book I saw showing up in the house and the suggestion that I was mentally unwell, I was hugely fucked up for a while. I identify much of my dad’s behavior throughout my childhood as narcissistic. I’ve spent a good few counseling sessions and numerous minutes deathly terrified that I was a narcissist. Putting it mildly, being a narcissist is not something I take lightly merely after seeing a book on the dining room table.</p>

<p>People have told me on a few occasions that I used them in relationships. That’s enough to make a pattern, for sure. One person privately admitted to using me in reality, but the damage had already been done—to my knowledge, they have never repeated what they told me to the people who dropped me when the relationship ended. My closest friends have left me as they saw this pattern unfolding. They weren’t wrong to do so, though it hurt like a second divorce.</p>

<p>It’s all too alluring in my brain to believe that I am what I provide to others. I wonder if this wasn’t why Jesus fasted in the desert for forty days. Ridding himself of the need to be for others what he intuited they wanted from him. I am still exorcizing from myself this demon. I have lost track of the number of times that I have contorted myself into relationships and within existing relationships, hoping to manipulate a favorable outcome only to fail when I could no longer maintain the facade that I had no needs myself—sometimes this took the form of resentment.</p>

<p>I’ve fucked up a lot of people with this pattern. I hate that fact. Family, partners, friends; I was never able to admit to any of the involved parties that I could no longer maintain the facade and my realization would often be quite sudden. I’ve deeply hurt all of these people. I have believed that a failed relationship was always an indictment against me intrinsically. I wanted to save my loved ones from this version of me that I have not been able to accept of myself.</p>

<p>I’ve become countless different people in my life to fit what I thought were the desires and needs of my partners. I was on the verge once again this weekend of repeating this pattern. I’ll go so far as to say that I believe this was part of Lucifer’s sin. Lucifer knew he could give others what they wanted and believed that this made him most powerful. While it indeed made Lucifer powerful and threatened god’s dominion, I wonder if it doesn’t highlight the fallacy of overusing the fawn—charm—response? Lucifer became overly charming which threatened a father figure who ruled by threat of vengeance.</p>

<p>No, I won’t go further on that point as this dichotomy is beyond thin. Charm, sure, wins out over fear in many cases but that’s not where I’m going here. Have I manipulated people? Absolutely. Has it been conscious? Predominantly no. Has this manipulation been malevolent? In no way yes. My manipulation has been a learned act of survival.</p>

<p>Being an act of survival does not excuse a habit unexamined. This, this right here, is 1000% on me. Right here—if I may assert—is where I am your satan. However, satan is not an external being. No, I’m not going into the concept today of how I believe that God is Satan is God.</p>

<p>This is the codependent paradigm: I will be your savior until you see me as your satan. The difference between the two is a razor’s edge. Inevitably, I have set up myself to be one extreme or the other.</p>

<p>Sadly, I have chosen to believe the worst opinions others have of me as those I choose to ingest. Like junk food. I’ve had real work to do over the past several years and I’ve done some of it. I will continue to work on this part of me. I saw some of the remaining work I have this weekend. I also chose differently this weekend. That’s fucking growth.</p>

<p>Recognizing and pointing this out as growth is progress itself. This does not come without the sting of an old friend accusing me of less than above board behavior this weekend. That fucking sucks. There was a part of me that racked my brain to see how I might have tried to act poorly toward this person with whom I recently reconnected.</p>

<p>I tried to poke any hole in my recollection that might lead to my being a bad person to them. My attempts at poking holes only led to more questions—I couldn’t rationalize a way that I had unconsciously or subconsciously tried to make a dig at them. Honestly, this introspection took longer than it should have. My aim is to be aware, mindful, and humble these days. I was so ready to blame myself for something that did and does indeed appear manipulative from several angles.</p>

<p>I am not a bad person—as I’ve thought throughout most of my life. Honestly, I’ve believed some terrible things about myself in the past several years as I’ve carefully manicured and manipulated narratives for family, friends, and intimates. Honestly, I was scared of what their opinions dictated about me more so than what I thought I knew about myself to be true. Regardless of external opinions, and perhaps because of them, I have the opportunity to think better about myself and certainly do better. This is doubtlessly a better time to continue to change than any other.</p>

<p>To reiterate, I’ve fucked up a lot in my life. In catastrophic and massive ways. Much of this has been the result of making poor choices and sticking with them. The majority of these decisions—I strongly believe—have been the result of feeling overly vulnerable and an unwillingness to examine those feelings. Rather than feeling exposed, I chose “comfort” and found some way to hide what I was actually experiencing.</p>

<p>I’ve tried so hard to preserve the people that I care about and love from the parts of myself that I consider unlovable. I’ve hurt them—these beautiful humans—in ways that I wish never to have hurt my worst enemies. However, my attempts to save these people from these consequences have been rooted in self-preservation, hoping to present myself as greater than human, and I’ve deeply hurt a lot of people that I care about. There are not enough words to adequately express this; I accept that this will all be misunderstood.</p>

<p>Today, I’m less about hiding. I still hide what feels most exposing emotionally. I have a lot of work to do. While I may not highlight this fact, I will never deny its importance, much less its truth. This human is a consistent work in progress. I hope forever to be one.</p>

<p>To a large extent, each of us are who we believe ourselves to be. I can be Jesus—Yeshua—or Satan. Where I choose to focus my attention and energy is where I will trend, one side or the other. My terror that I might indeed be inherently evil will assuredly guarantee self-centered, poor behavior. The alternative will better ensure more expansive, other-centric, and life-giving behavior and sense of being.</p>

<p>Perhaps you and I are all God in that we create ourselves and our realities on a daily basis. Maybe not, but isn’t it worth believing that we are the best versions of ourselves we could be in case “choseness” is real? Fuck, isn’t being the best person you—each of us—could be just worth it? Surely it must be. Surely. Love you, friend.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Most of my life I’ve thought myself to be Lucifer.

<p>We had thunderstorms roll through this afternoon as a cold front swooped in like a blustery blanket accompanied with sheets of rain. I made an event of it, turning out the lights, opening the shades, and planting myself in front of the kitchen window. It didn’t always use to be this way.<!--more--></p>

<p>One of the more traumatic memories of my childhood involved a thunderstorm. I was probably three, and my dad was grilling some meat—chicken, I believe—preparing dinner one evening. As I recall it, this was the most blinding lightning display I had witnessed, the most violent thunder symphony I had ever experienced. I was scared, growing more terrified with each nearly deafening clap of thunder. Yet my dad was committed to attending the grill on the deck.</p>

<p>I don’t remember how it came to pass. My dad hoisted me up on his shoulders after my declining to want to venture out into the storm with my saturated father. Queue full-on terror as my dad walked around the deck, lightning flashing, thunder cracking. I screamed and screamed, pleading for him to let me live and take me back inside. He was trying to convince me that we were having fun—joking and laughing.</p>

<p>After maybe a couple of minutes, my dad got the hint that perhaps his plan to desensitize me to the lightning and thunder would not succeed. He helped me descend his shoulders, and I retreated into the safety of a dry towel and my mom’s soothing.</p>

<p>It was an incredibly impactful event. I used to wake up screaming for my parents to save me when I found myself surprised by a late-night or early-morning thunderstorm at least until the age of thirteen. Thirteen, I kid you not. That last time, my parents told me I could go to their room if I needed them and was scared—facepalm. Halting. Terror.</p>

<p>My mom tried to make it better, telling me that the thunder was the angels bowling—yes, I got that explanation too. I would pray that those overzealous angels would bowl worse and not get any strikes. Clearly, those prayers weren’t answered. The angels were jerks, I rationalized. Or they were that good at bowling.</p>

<p>Truthfully, I have no idea when the switch flipped. I love thunderstorms now. Have for some time. Don’t get me wrong, I still have this three-year-old kid inside of me who needs a little soothing when the thunder gets loud enough, or that first loud clap of thunder breaks the rhythm of the rain, surprising me.</p>

<p>I’m trying to figure out why I knew I had to write about this. I think that at this stage of my journey, especially regarding faith and spirituality, thunderstorms are one of the ways where my self-importance takes a backseat. I am simply—ironically—in childlike awe, enamored.</p>

<p>Maybe spirituality’s why these words were so crucial for me to type into reality. Experiencing God—whatever you want to call the divine or that which is bigger than us—has been taking on a much different form over the past several months. Thunderstorms, to me, are now better than the most convicting, moving sermon I can recall.</p>

<p>At the end of nature’s sermon, if you will, I’m not left feeling manipulated, used, or downright icky. There is no guilt when the storm passes, just magnificence and the subtle, intricate beauty of the clouds’ myriad greys.</p>

<p>What takes away your breath? What stops you in your tracks, demanding your full attention? Where do you find astonishment and awe these days? Soak up those moments. Be as present to them as you can. For the moments you experience captivation or whatever you wish to call it, let that be everything. That is enough.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[We had thunderstorms roll through this afternoon as a cold front swooped in like a blustery blanket accompanied with sheets of rain.

<p>It’s been a heavy week for me, and if I’m honest, I’m forcing myself in front of this keyboard. My self-doubt has nearly convinced me that the words I will type will fail the thoughts and ideas underlying them even before the first keystroke. I suppose this is my attempt a transparency today, so I hope you can forgive its awkward clunkiness and keep reading with me as the words unfold.<!--more--></p>

<p>I’ve been learning a lot about myself in the past few days, particularly in the context of close relationships. It feels like the realizations and mini-revelations keep coming at me as if they were traveling near light speed. So it seems the only reasonable choice is to absorb and feel the impact of each as sober-mindedly as possible.</p>

<p>Self-abandonment is a bitch. I learned as a child to abandon my true self and play the role that would best elicit love, care, attention, and acceptance—showing up as my whole self I discarded as an option, a pattern that I carry into all of my relationships to date. While I say that I’m comfortable with my muchness, my actions scream that I am terrified of being <em>too much</em>.</p>

<p>Truth be told, I am too much for some people—this reaction is rarely about me, though. I am so swayed even still by the responses of others that this perceived rejection hurts to the point that I am willing to give up or abandon parts of me to maintain tenuous relationships that give life to no one. And I can suffer through the pain of this constriction and restriction for quite a while, I’ve learned.</p>

<p>These relationships sap my energy, and the constriction only multiplies the amount of energy I willingly give up day by day.</p>

<p>This pattern is my narcissism. To call it anything less would be to delay further the necessary change and growth taking place in me. All of this is about me and my need to control the relationships I participate in by manipulating myself and the situation. I am not fulfilling the real needs of the other person in my adaptability—self-abandonment. No, I am meeting my intuitive perception of what that person needs, which is often projection.</p>

<p>I feed on the reaction to my shape-shifting like a vampire, but I can never be satisfied. With this pattern in place, I set myself and others up for failure from the get-go because there is no basis for a fulfilling relationship—that requires at least two <em>whole</em> people.</p>

<p>It should come as no surprise that I also have trouble expressing the emotions I am so attuned to in these relationships. If I am constantly holding back my whole self, I do not give the other person the chance to show themselves as safe; this protects me against what I see as the inevitable abandonment by the other person. Thus, I have created a shitty catch-22 for myself where I lose either way.</p>

<p>Not only is this my narcissism, but it is perhaps my most profound insanity.</p>

<p>Regardless of what I have experienced repeatedly and what I know to be true, I repeat this pattern ad nauseam. I am terrified to trust in the muchness of others to be enough to match my own. It feels so much safer always to be too much—damn my neurology’s love of binaries.</p>

<p>I know that there are those of you who can relate—breaking the proverbial fourth wall. In one way, or more, or another, you grew up receiving the message that you were chronically too much. So, you too crumpled, crinkled yourself like paper wadding up itself in preparation to be thrown into the wastebasket.</p>

<p>Is our smallness worth it?</p>

<p>What do we gain by stuffing ourselves into too-small boxes? We are constantly overflowing, re-stuffing the parts of us that inevitably breach the confines of our self-confinement back into places where we never fit to begin. We spend so much internal energy convincing ourselves to stay too long.</p>

<p>We broadcast the message through our self-abandonment that we are expecting and meant for others to abandon us. Then, once we’ve overstayed yet another relationship—perhaps we’ve also self-sabotaged in the process—the other person finally sees that the most prudent decision is to walk away. So we are devastated once again, and we also keep ourselves feeling safe as we have perpetuated the old pattern.</p>

<p>I see that this pattern, the sense of perceived safety I feel in perpetuating it, may not actually be worth it. I’ve given up so much in my life, and I have experienced tremendous devastation and loss in my relationships. It’s time that I explore a different choice, scary as it is.</p>

<p>Maybe I’ll let people surprise me. But, yes, I feel the fear rising up in me as I type those words. However, I can’t continue this. No, I know too much.</p>

<p>Love y’all.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[It’s been a heavy week for me, and if I’m honest, I’m forcing myself in front of this keyboard.

<p>Working in mental health is a pretty thankless career path, and I’m grateful for that fact. Working in substance use within the field, as I see firsthand, is a particular kind of thanklessness. But I have chosen it to help circumvent the savior complex so many therapists encounter at one point or another.<!--more--></p>

<p>However, Tara Brach said in <em>Radical Acceptance</em> that people come to her, a renowned therapist, to be with her settled nervous system. This truth immediately struck me as true. I’ve sought ways in the past few months to further and maintain my settling. Perhaps that’s helped in the past several weeks at work, but my nervous system isn’t the focus of this post—stick with me another second.</p>

<p>I had a session earlier today with a person who had adamantly refused to meet with me since I started this job nearly five months ago. I can’t tell you the number of times that the staff at my facility have asked if I worked with this person or suggested that they talk to me. Today they caved—I was serendipitously there when a couple of staff members cornered them, flat-out told them that was the case, and they caved, “…for fifteen minutes.”</p>

<p>Less than fifteen seconds into the session, they were sobbing—this tough, thick-crusted human. They talked about how they were depressed and told me the many factors that contributed to that. I didn’t fight back the tears as I suspected they would further tear down their dense walls, but my eyelids barely contained them.</p>

<p>I was in the very presence of God in those many minutes. This human who was so tough in appearance being so brave, vulnerable.</p>

<p>It was as if I was experiencing Christ discuss how deep, tremendous, and sudden loss led him to use substances to keep himself alive—to cope, as we might say. In that moment, I was “the least of these” listening to the gospel of a Christ enduring addiction which began as a survival method. As I’ve said before, addiction often starts as an adaptive mechanism our bodies utilize to survive trauma.</p>

<p>I fixed nothing for them, yet I felt like those precious minutes validated the past few months of work and the work I have done over the past few months on my own as a client in therapy. Even typing this, I viscerally feel once again the grief and lament of this beautiful human. At the same time, I want to defend them against the common interpretation of their toughness that they have felt over many years that they must embrace.</p>

<p>The human I saw in that space was brave and tender, not fearful and attacking. In many ways, I saw how I wish I could be more courageous in my everyday life and speak the feelings truthfully I so viscerally feel in almost any given moment. In a way, I find it so much easier to hold space for this bravery than to be the brave one—I envy this tremendous courage.</p>

<p>Sure, others have burned me when I’ve been vulnerable, but I’ve known that would be the outcome on some level. It’s undoubtedly been deeply hurtful each time, but in a certain way, it’s what I’ve wanted to see continued in the world around me. What do I mean?</p>

<p>I mean that I have clung to a narrative that the people I love will inevitably abandon me—that felt comfortable and safe to me instead of a universe defined by abundance and love. I have repeatedly created or contributed significantly to scenarios where other people leave me by clinging to that narrative. Instead, I increasingly believe that the God in me, if you will, asks for as good as I choose to think that I deserve.</p>

<p>This framing is a fundamental paradigm shift from a highly Calvinist evangelical mindset fraught with original sin and predestination. I will go so far as to say that I believe it is this very frame of mind that referred to as changing God’s mind in the Hebrew Bible—yes, I’ll stake that claim. To distill this thought, God will, despite God’s desires for me, generally give me what I ask.</p>

<p>The pesky aspect of this thought is that the Bible quotes Jesus as saying—it’s something I take with a grain of salt in a literal sense, and it’s worth noting since the Bible includes it—whatever one asks of God believing God has already provided will be blessed. What might happen if we believed we were each divine, gods, and shared the mind of God? What might happen if we all accepted our bodily sensation, intelligence, intuition, etc., as that with which we share with God? Dare I say, this concept is something that this human who is supposed to be a client taught me once more earlier today.</p>

<p>What’s would it be like to trust your mind, body, or the God/Flow/Source/Universe in you more confidently?</p>

<p>I imagine if more of us did that, believing that we deserved more than we came to understand as children, this would be a vastly different world. For what are you waiting?</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Working in mental health is a pretty thankless career path, and I’m grateful for that fact.

<p>In honor of the holiday on the calendar tomorrow, I will be talking about love. However, it will not at all be in the way that you might expect. No, today, I’m talking about the correlation between love and substance use.<!--more--></p>

<p>I recently started working as a Substance Abuse Counselor, the title I find off-putting. I quickly noticed how ridiculous it was to me that there is a question in the intake asking whether the people I see have experienced any traumatic events in their lives. This question seems ridiculous because regardless of whether the person in front of me classifies certain events as traumatic, they all have a trauma history.</p>

<p>I recognize that this is in part confirmation bias as I learned to look for underlying trauma in the context of atypical substance use. I prefer some version of the term “atypical substance use” as it feels more human than referring to people as substance abusers or people who abuse substances. To me, the very idea of abusing something not living feels farcical, like referring to property damage as violence, so I’m glad the clinical term employs “substance use,” but I still dislike speaking of disorders. In every story I have heard, my digression aside, there has been at least one traumatic event involving a caregiver, but rarely is there only one event. No, I typically see a string of deep betrayals and abandonment.</p>

<p>In their unique way, each learned that the people they love most would leave them, injure them, hurt them, withhold the very love they deserve and need; people are simply not safe. By the time these people become adults, grown children with festering mortal love wounds, they have resorted to something else that will fill the gaping hole and numb the ache that relationships—now seen as profoundly unsafe—were meant to fill. If only for a few minutes, the person can participate in a sort of relationship they know they can rely on, perhaps for the first time in their lives.</p>

<p>This relationship is the allure of the substance. It is like a best friend and a lover at once to the person who can no longer trust humans. Somehow, we seek to punish these people. In some twisted form of logic, we have created a system that punishes the tormented. In so doing, we drive them further from people and relationships. I am not saying that these people are unable to love, though.</p>

<p>Many of the people that I see have married and parented children whom they love sincerely. However, the people who I diagnose with disordered substance use seem to primarily be in relationship with the substance or substances as the case may be. These beautiful people love their families with all of their hearts, but their capacity is constrained to the extent that they use substances to manipulate the darker emotions. We cannot numb certain emotions without numbing all of them—numbing grief diminishes our capacity for joy.</p>

<p>Here is what most of us do not understand about these resilient people: they developed their substance use as an <em>adaptive</em> strategy. Literally, their substance use has helped them survive. However, the institutions and oppressive systems that operate have us believing these are weak and broken people—they are no less human and no more broken than you or me.</p>

<p>Thankfully, my profession has moved away from the disease model of substance use, treating atypical substance use like an infection. As with everything, the practice of substance abuse counseling is a slow-moving ship, and the public perception that the profession culpably created in part is even slower to change. There is nothing criminal or defective about people trying to get the attachment or relational nutrients they need to survive from substances because people have so abjectly and repeatedly failed them.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Once more: there is nothing criminal or defective about people trying to get the attachment or relational nutrients they need to survive from substances because people have so abjectly and repeatedly failed them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Finding sustenance where there is none is truly remarkable to me. Over time, as I’ve seen, these people can find a way to make entire lives without deep human relationships. Several of my clients express a strong desire to be left alone and go out of their way to avoid human contact to a large degree. They are starving for love and can find no way to receive that from people, so they resort to the only truly reliable and dependable thing in their lives.</p>

<p>We have created an entire criminal justice system that penalizes and brutally punishes these people primarily for trying to survive. Horrifically, the war on drugs, which so many of us are ardent supporters of, criminalizes vilifies these hurting people. Through imprisonment, parole, and the complex system we have woven together, it’s almost certain that these people are only driven further away from society and people almost sentenced to a life of increased substance use.</p>

<p>This is a very dark topic for a post that started off talking about love. But you see, you cannot speak about atypical substance use without acknowledging that many of these people were driven there as a survival response to a lack of love. And to talk about substance use without mentioning the criminal in-justice system is in and of itself criminal. However, speaking about substance use without mentioning the context of the criminal justice system and vice versa is how we have gotten ourselves into the predicament we find ourselves in today.</p>

<p>You tell me, should we be criminalizing these humans?</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[In honor of the holiday on the calendar tomorrow, I will be talking about love.

<p>“This will be the last letter I ever write you,” the note began. I couldn’t believe I was finally writing it; it was unfathomable that it had taken me so long. As hard as it was to break up with the old church, my community, marriage, and former life, God was the hardest to leave behind—that’s why it took me more than three years when all the others had been a matter of months. I will warn you that this post might be particularly triggering for many.<!--more--></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have to be done—for me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have much better insight into why people stay in abusive relationships. The fear of leaving without anything to catch you when you fall is greater than the fear of the abuse itself. Change is too much for a nervous system always registering threats day in, day out. The unknown is crushing when we are juggling the ongoing threat of the next abuse, the next psychological or emotional wound.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I left the narcissist once and for all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let that sink in—I left behind the god who demands my worship. I walked away from the deity who considers himself so great that he needs humans and angels to worship him and prop up his fragile ego, day and night. I cut off the vain one who for so long required sacrifices in his name.</p>

<p>I would no longer accept this tiny god who needed me to keep feeling small to make him feel and look bigger. I will no longer subject myself to the label of “sinner” so that a god who has justified genocide, domestic violence, and murder can feel better about himself or seem less evil. I sin in that I am not always generous or good to my fellow humans, I accept that I am flawed, but “sinner” shall never be my name—even Jesus referred to people as gods.</p>

<p>I finally accepted that god could never allow for the space I needed in the relationship to expand into my true self. This acknowledgment was too threatening to this insecure little man. He felt threatened by my freedom, and his insecurity stifled me.</p>

<p>I have felt myself expanding in the past few years; really, I have experienced a rapid series of metamorphoses. Yet, I have subtly acknowledged that this relationship, if I can call it that, was holding me back—it could only hold me back. Recognizing my greatness could only be seen through the lens of diminishing god’s own.</p>

<p>No longer would I accept this take-take dynamic. I was always responsible for coming to god, initiating conversations, and on his terms. Anything good that happened to me was thanks to him; I had to attribute the bad to my fallenness or sinfulness. I was always giving my best, striving, trying, but what did I receive directly from him?</p>

<p>How often did he try to get to know me? How often was I ever accepted as who I was? No, not once—god only loved me once I was “in Christ,” putting on a costume.</p>

<p>Gaslighting will never again be tolerated or normalized in my life. I was always too limited, too finite to know him—any incongruity I picked up on was merely explained away as his ways were higher than mine. There was always a justification for his absence, atrocities, or anything else that seemed out of character.</p>

<p>I will no longer excuse his abandonment in his long silences where I wonder once more how I’m not listening or what I’ve done to cause it. He has shown me his true colors, and he simply disappears when it’s convenient for him, reappearing whenever he chooses without any communication; he’s the king of ghosting. Ain’t nobody got time for that.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have to be done—for me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I finally take my leave because I’ve said goodbye several times before, and he hasn’t once respected this boundary. My sovereignty is worth taking that first step into the unknown, even if the anxiety is just too much. I wrote the letter only yesterday, but even the unknown is, at last, better than what can never be.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[“This will be the last letter I ever write you,” the note began.

<p>I feel a tremendous weight has been placed on the past few days, the first days since the constant calamity of 2020. I have certainly felt more hopeful and ready for a new year than perhaps ever, but I see that this expectation is not without weight. That weight, I’ve realized, has given my inner critic more input than is typical—especially since I have made that the focus of a fair amount of my work.<!--more--></p>

<p>I was re-acclimating my feet to my soccer cleats on a nearby turf field when I burst out (in my head), “You’re an asshole!” I’d felt this tension rising, but I had been trying to counter the critic’s cutting criticism with compassionate words without acknowledging him directly. I had reached a boiling point and let him have it.</p>

<p>“You’re an asshole!” I blurted out, “Nothing is ever good enough for you! Nothing can ever be!” This is nothing new. In that moment, I was talking about my expectations for how quickly and proficiently I should be completing this arbitrary running exercise I concocted after I had put on my cleats.</p>

<p>Yet, even as the conversation started, I knew it was about so much more than the workout. Conversations with my critic—as I suspect is the case for us all—are never only about a single moment in the present. Like every other I can remember, this conversation was about some insidious implicit messages I received growing up.</p>

<p>I felt like my dad pushed me harder than he did my sister, and I perceived my parents praising my sister more frequently than they did me. Growing up, I felt less celebrated and less able to explore my strengths. I understood the best I could at the time that all that I didn’t receive—and the criticism I did receive along the way—was caused by my not being competent, proficient, tough, or patient enough; my imperfections were mortal wounds keeping me from the love and nurturing I desired most.</p>

<p>I recognize that as I haven’t felt like I’m hitting the ground running this year, I’ve allowed him to speak louder. I’m so ready after graduating and searching for jobs these past few weeks to move on—I <em>expected it</em> somehow by today, yesterday—but that hasn’t happened. Finally, when the tension of the past few days came to a head, I got pissed off.</p>

<p>A funny thing happened at this point. I got angry, yelled at the asshole, and then I got curious, and started listening again. That was how I realized where my inner critic got what he was wrongly trying to tell me.</p>

<p>He was indeed being a jerk, but sometimes that jerk can push me toward doing a better job than I would have done otherwise. Sometimes, like this afternoon, he’s just a jerk. But why’s he being a jerk?</p>

<p>My inner critic is trying to be helpful most of the time, but he doesn’t understand compassion or empathy—that’s not his job. What he’s saying may be for my emotional or physical protection. You see, he carries a certain wisdom with him that he’s accrued over the past few decades. He simply doesn’t know how to package the message because he’s an asshole.</p>

<p>Then, there are sometimes when he’s just that asshole who doesn’t know when to shut up. He’s perceived some threat to our existence or wellbeing and feels the need to let me know vociferously. This is when I have to tell him that his input was not desired, let alone needed.</p>

<p>One of the most valuable lessons I learned in the past fifteen months was working on my inner observer. In essence, this is that part of the mind that can notice our emotions and thoughts non-judgmentally. It is the capacity to be curious about what we are doing and thinking and our reasons for doing so.</p>

<p>After my outburst, as I said earlier, I got curious and asked the critic why he was talking to me the way that he was and how his message had to do with keeping us safe. He was somewhat flustered and responded briskly. I noticed that his rationale did not line up—as I said, he was being an asshole—and then asked where we got this message of “never enough-ness.”</p>

<p>I’m tearing up as I type this, but what I understood in where my mind went once I asked this question is a gift. My inner critic held onto this implicit message to help us plumb all the love and nurturing that was available during my childhood—he kept me well and in some aspects alive in this way. I am so grateful for that. Yet, today I don’t really need to be told that I’m not enough. This doesn’t serve me.</p>

<p>Presciently, as I was leaving the park, I received a message beginning with the words “It’s ok to be proud of yourself.” from a friend. The Universe has a beautiful way of sealing in those messages we need most, just in the way that we can understand what is happening. I walked to Target, feeling the cold breeze against my exposed face, hands, and legs, noting the warmth emanating from inside—up from my back, stomach, chest, and into my cheeks.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I feel a tremendous weight has been placed on the past few days, the first days since the constant calamity of 2020.

<p>Over a month-and-a-half ago, I confronted the idea that evangelicalism—all of it—is an abusive system. In therapy, I found out that the revelation is still fucking with the internal dissonance that I’ve called equilibrium the past three years. However, I’m grateful for this insight.<!--more--></p>

<p>I’ve known for a couple of years that I experienced religious trauma. At first, I wanted to minimize its effects because I wasn’t involved in a “proper” cult. That’s what I wanted to believe.</p>

<p>Internally, I knew that wasn’t true, and I came around to the truth that my experience in Christianity, specifically evangelicalism, was traumatic to me. Period. I did not need a caveat.</p>

<p>The only important question is—despite what I want to believe—what effects do I experience today? Sure enough, my therapist asked today if I was familiar with religious trauma. Shit.</p>

<p>I’ve naively wanted to believe that the effects were in my past, and I’ve worked through the bullshit. That’s not the case, but deep down, I knew this all along. I’m aware that I’m still decoupling myself from the Aristotelian concept that the embodied experience was perverse and to be denied.</p>

<p>I have grown to trust my body leaps and bounds more than I did a few years ago, with lots of help, but I still experience moments of doubt. My inner critic wants to self-flagellate for this supposed weakness, but undoing three decades worth of indoctrination—brainwashing—takes time and effort. I can take solace from the fact that I know I’m doing the work, and I had my work cut out for me from the beginning.</p>

<p>I could expect no less when I had invested so much of myself in the system. Until right before I left the church and the system associated with it, I was “serving” behind the scenes no less than every other week, attending bible study and discipleship, and leading worship every few weeks. I was even attending seminary at this point—however, this ended up being my escape vehicle.</p>

<p>I was attending a rather conservative seminary within reach of the metro at the time. Despite itself, or perhaps because of itself, I realized that covenant theology understood the greater arc of covenants within the bible as evermore expansive. I could no longer pretend that my dissonance was sin, misunderstanding, or an inability to grasp the subject.</p>

<p>I got an A in the class, so understanding—<em>I</em>—was, more than likely, not the problem. I was finally able to let go of the crushing tension that my tremendous belief in and desire for inclusion was not incongruent with the bible’s themes. However, I was still, and I still am today, an outsider in the good ole boys club. It was a familiar role in many ways.</p>

<p>When my then-wife suggested a separation, I held out in attending church—albeit a different service. Though, after two months and a pastor declaring that the creation myths in Genesis were literal accounts, I happily wiped my hands of the flawed theology. Yet, I had so much to mourn.</p>

<p>This occurrence was right around the time that the head pastor told me I was leaning too heavily on my support network—my friends who were all within the church at this point. I knew that I had to detach completely; what I didn’t know was where I could safely attach. To put it bluntly, I was fucked.</p>

<p>Not to leave you hanging, I realized that I could rely on my family and remembered that I had some longstanding friends outside of the church, so I survived. I don’t take this concept lightly, as many people don’t have the support system outside of the church—that’s by insidious design—and terrible things happen to them as a result. I consider myself incredibly fortunate.</p>

<p>I have now graduated from a Lutheran school three years later and a program with heavy evangelical influences. I still have a relationship with my mom and stepdad, who belong to a Presbyterian church, along with my mom’s parents, who seem somewhere between Baptist and Presbyterian. However, I am not a fan of doing the “easy” thing.</p>

<p>Perhaps this is residual from my understanding myself as not enough growing up, or maybe it’s my more recently understood sense of resilience—most likely, it’s both. As I have believed for a few years, I don’t care that I’m capable of doing anything essentially. There isn’t a scenario that terrifies me to my core. Now that I’ve said that, there are situations and conversations where I’m concerned that I will lose connection with the people I love.</p>

<p>Returning from my tangent, I recognize that using religious language to communicate anything less than love and acceptance to the recipient when the communicator intends love is triggering to me still. In many ways, I find the trauma wrought by evangelicalism impossible to extricate from these ultimately unloving statements—despite their intent.</p>

<p>Sadly, people still caught in the system cannot see it for what the system is. These people do not have the perspective to understand that they carry out the role of both abused and abuser. The system is precisely operating as the founders designed. I have a hard time believing that any system designed solely by white men of privilege—especially one maintained by this same demographic over five centuries later—is a sustainable system.</p>

<p>Spoiler alert, this system is not sustainable, and I don’t feel guilty for jumping ship. The pull to feel guilt or to return to the fold in some fashion is strong. These are some of the tentacles of this parasitic belief system. Growing up, I believed there was a form of symbiosis. I came to find that it was a religiously glorified multilevel marketing scam perpetuated over centuries and not just years or decades.</p>

<p>I’m still understanding how letting go looks and feels. However, it’s a journey worth taking as I am invested wholeheartedly in finding and maintaining my sense of Self—I will not lose my Self once more. Tragically, I do not see a form of Christianity today where I can find Christ without losing myself. I hope to be proven wrong tomorrow.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over a month-and-a-half ago, I confronted the idea that evangelicalism—all of it—is an abusive system.
