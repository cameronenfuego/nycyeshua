  <h1 >everything is love</h1>

  <div class="entry">
    <p>These are the words of a guest who’s staying with my family in anticipation of my brother’s wedding. As the kitchen silenced last night, he began a speech and in that speech, he spoke profoundly, “I figured out that business is love…Everything is love.” And the simplicity in summing up life in that very moment nearly brought me to tears.</p>

<p><strong>Everything is love.</strong> This man had boiled down the Christian message, really in three words. And we as Christians know this message. We know that God is love, Jesus came down to love man perfectly. The Bible is chock full of examples of God’s love for us. Yes, we get this, but rarely do we rehearse it and refresh it in our minds.</p>

<p><strong>Our head knowledge isn’t the problem.</strong> We know the message, but we’ve forgotten (maybe we never knew) how to apply it. It’s simple. <em>Everything</em> is love. Even in the way we go about standing in line for our morning coffees. Even the way we sit on the train/bus on the way to work. The motivations for saying the things we do are most certainly included here. Let me reiterate: not a single breath is to be taken without a purpose to use it for a loving cause.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So now faith, hope, and love abide, these three; but the greatest of these is love. — I Corinthians 13:13</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There’s no need to complicate this message. That complication is of our own devise. What holds us back, what tears others down is fear. Where love is everything, there is no room for fear. And without fear, there can be no hate. Love is everything. And let everything we do today forth be in love.</p>
