<p>I’ve continued churning through the idea of conquering monsters and I realized I needed to readjust the way I speak about monsters. It also dawned on me that I could help you with a little context as to where this word ‘monsters’ is coming from. So, I invite you to see with me where this goes.<!--more--></p>

<p>I started reading through <a href="https://www.amazon.com/How-Survive-Shipwreck-Help-Already/dp/0310347971/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=">“How to Survive a Shipwreck: Help Is On the Way and Love Is Already Here” by Jonathan Martin</a> the day after that fateful conversation with my wife. I can only conclude that meeting the author — he’s a remarkable man — was undeniably God’s grace, and my ordering the book that night and its subsequent arrival a godsend. On Sunday, I did not know that my own ship was in the process of wrecking. Well, Mr. Martin refers to monsters as the creatures that inhabit our own inner darknesses.</p>

<p>What most caught my attention was that Mr. Martin — I’m calling him Jonathan from here on, because I’ve actually met the man and had a conversation with him — contextualizes these monsters in the Job story. Look back at it and you’ll see that God talks about Leviathan in chapter forty-one. God refers to Leviathan as a household pet essentially to tame and put on a leash. I don’t know about you, but this isn’t the God I know or remember. Who is this God? This God is a God much bigger than the god I keep in my back pocket or in my day-to-day prayers. This God is powerful beyond my comprehension, but also immensely loving and compassionate. The God in this passage is a lover of and friend to monsters. What. The. Hell?</p>

<p>I don’t have the time here to go into the broader implications of this, as they are more vast than I understand. However, I am not a monster. I can say this with certainty. But, I have monsters within me. God doesn’t want to kill them, though. I want to kill them. The latter doesn’t much matter, as they’re bigger than me; I can’t put them to death on my own, no matter how badly I wish I could. Instead, God wants to tame them and befriend them. God wants to <em>know</em> them. God wants to <em>know</em> me. Every. Single. Aspect. God doesn’t reject any part of me.</p>

<p>My own self-loathing now seems…prideful. God doesn’t want to kill the ugly parts of me, even though He could in a breath. He doesn’t want to hide, erase, or otherwise remove what I consider unsightly. Why should I continue seeking to do otherwise? Is my judgment better than His?</p>

<p>I have a lot to learn about loving myself. There is a long way for me to go before I feel I am able to embrace and know intimately my monsters. Luckily, I cannot nor am I supposed to tame and love them on my own. I have the help of my Father the Leviathan tamer. I have friends, my community, and family. Monster taming, too, is a community effort. I think I’m ready to go diving into my depths a little further this time.</p>
