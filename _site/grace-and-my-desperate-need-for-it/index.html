  <h1 >grace and my desperate need for it</h1>

  <div class="entry">
    <p>It’s hard running a small blog. I’d imagine it’s harder than running a large one. Why? Because I don’t get a whole lot of feedback and so even when I feel like my words aren’t being received well, it’s hard to pinpoint what’s causing the negative reaction.</p>

<p>Talking about my audience, you, isn’t why I’m here, though. I only use that to say I hope I don’t come off as less in need of grace than anyone else. Why is this important right now? Well, I was reading more in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Ragamuffin-Gospel-Bedraggled-Beat-Up/dp/1590525027/ref=pd_sim_b_1/182-8096308-2219225"><em>The Ragamuffin Gospel</em></a> by Brennan Manning and it brought the need for grace directly to my attention. See, needing grace less would mean that I have something else to rely on, and, you see, I have nothing else. Nothing. Grace is all I’ve really got going for me. And that’s the way it should be.</p>

<h4 id="grace-embracesflaws">Grace embraces flaws</h4>

<p>See, the grace of God isn’t His ignoring our flaws and shortcomings. No, it’s His deep recognition of each and every one of them and embracing them all. He loves me <em>with</em> every blemish and imperfection, not <em>in spite of</em> them. And therein lies the crucial distinction.</p>

<h4 id="grace-depends-on-nothingelse">Grace depends on nothing else</h4>

<p>God loves me because He is good and gracious. There is nothing that I have, nothing that I’ve done, nothing that I am that could ever earn His love and favor. And there is nothing that ever could.</p>

<h4 id="the-relief-ofgrace">The relief of grace</h4>

<p>This is the relief of grace. There is nothing I need to do. There is nothing I need to be. There is <em>nothing</em>. Nothing I need to earn or maintain. I am simply free to be. I am enough in who He has made me. And that is good enough for Him. <strong>I am good enough for Him.</strong> And so are you.</p>

<p>Thinking into grace is a scary thing. It forces us to shed our performance mindset and cast aside our Facebook-selves. It burns to rubble all our feats, trophies, efforts, and accomplishments and lays us bare. Yet, it is this nakedness that God, in His infinite grace, <em>loves</em>. It is because of His grace that He loves. <strong>And we are merely free to be the very picture of imperfection we are today. Because that imperfection is enough for Him.</strong> Who else can tell us otherwise?</p>
