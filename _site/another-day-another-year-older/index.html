  <h1 >another day, another year older</h1>

  <div class="entry">
    <p>I get pretty introspective at two times a year. Given the proximity of those times, it oftentimes ends up just blurring into a month and a half or so of introspection starting with my birthday and lasting through Christmas. So, you’ll have to excuse me if that’s where this blog goes for the foreseeable future. However, I’m not here to talk about introspection. I’m here instead to talk about growth and maturity.</p>

<h4 id="listening-to-the-doubts-of-gettingolder">Listening to the doubts of getting older</h4>

<p>A friend asked me this morning how it felt to be another year older, and I wasn’t sure how to respond. In that moment, I heard the whispering doubt now a decibel louder. It was saying, “You’ve now been on this earth for how long? And what do you have to show for it? What have you done with your life?” Needless to say, it made for a rather heavy ride into work.</p>

<h4 id="the-wisdom-of-gettingolder">The wisdom of getting older</h4>

<p>I’m still young, a baby to many with whom I’ve spoken, but I can honestly say I feel a hair wiser. And that wisdom tells me that while what I’ve done up to this point may not be tangible in many ways, but I am a full year wiser, more filled with God’s grace. And <em>that</em> I can see. How? God’s grace at work in our lives, the fruit that causes us to bear is obedience, and I can point to a few examples where I would not have obeyed previously. And friends, this gives me hope. Though I fear another year may have gone down the drain, that doubt is erased through the realization that growing older has brought with it a measure of obedience, and that is worth more than the year spent chasing it down.</p>

<p>Maybe you’re feeling somewhat similar to me today, friend. Take heart! Though you may not see colossal strides toward the finish line, remember that obedience, the delighting in God’s good, perfect and pleasing will, is fruit itself and that fruit is worth more than its weight in gold. Be encouraged today. You are loved deeply by a Father who is beaming with pride in <em>you</em>. Though you are another day older, you are not older in vain. No, He is working in you very tangibly, steadfast toward your sanctification and His glory. Happy Friday!</p>
