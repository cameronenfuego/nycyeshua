  <h1 >gay marriage: where should christians stand?</h1>

  <div class="entry">
    <p>The striking down of DOMA the other week in the Supreme Court is probably old news by now. I believe the issue at hand, gay marriage, is just hitting its stride. And now the Church finds itself in a highly precarious position. If gay marriage is recognized by the Supreme Court, as well as a growing number of states, how are we to react?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And he said to him, “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. This is the great and first commandment. And a second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. On these two commandments depend all the Law and the Prophets.” — Matthew 22:37–40</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ve said this before, but the gay community is just as much our neighbors as anyone else. <em>Everyone</em> is our neighbor. Everyone. And we’re called to love them. <em>As ourselves</em>. There is no qualification here. So, first of all, we need to love those engaging in gay marriage.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“All things are lawful,” but not all things are helpful. “All things are lawful,” but not all things build up. — I Corinthians 10:23</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Stated the Supreme Court, gay marriage is just as legal as “traditional” marriage. Call me crazy, but in a country that touts separation of church and state, this ruling was merely a matter of time. And, from the standpoint of human Rights, it’s about time. Yes, it’s about time. On the land of freedom, gay marriage is finally recognized and the homosexual community is no longer bound to be second-class citizens.</p>

<p>Just because gay marriage is legal, doesn’t mean every gay Christian needs to off and get married the day their state legalizes it. Here is my caveat: we as Christians play by a different set of rules, have a separate lot in life from the rest of the world, as dictated by Christ. Therefore, we can still love our neighbors, but may have to take a second thought as to what engaging in gay marriage may speak about our following of Jesus. This, I leave up to the individual. To the leaders, homosexuals are no worse than the rest of this lying, cheating, stealing, lusting lot. They are just as deserving of love as the rest of the Body.</p>

<p>Am I crazy? Have I stepped out of line? Is gay marriage unforgivable in the Church? Do I go too far? Should homosexuals be set aside, cast aside for their sins? Are they living in any more sin than the rest of us? You tell me.</p>
