  <h1 >gifts of the spirit</h1>

  <div class="entry">
    <p><strong>Gifts of the Spirit.</strong> So, there I was sitting in front of a table full of adults leading a discussion on the Holy Spirit. I was teaching them on the gifts of the Spirit, a 23-year-old teaching a group over twice his age and they were hearing about these gifts as if for the first time. It was then I realized what an unknown quantity we like to maintain in the ghost-like member of the Trinity.</p>

<p><strong>We don’t like ghosts.</strong> I think we get nervous trying to tell people about a being that is ever-present, always working, but totally invisible. It’s hard to get into depth about the only member of the Trinity not covered in detail in the Bible. Therefore, we shy away from teaching about gifts from this mystical component to God. However, as a Christian, we are granted His presence in our lives for the duration. Given the amount of contact we have with this being, it’s imperative we understand Him a little better through His gifts.</p>

<p><strong>Take a few minutes.</strong> Read through that list, Christians, and see if any of those fit you. Then, go ask those closest to you to tell you which <em>they</em> see in you. Don’t worry, this post will still be here when you get back.</p>

<p><strong>Use it!</strong> You’ve been given so that you can use your gifting to give to others. If we’re not utilizing our gifts in a way intended (this means with forethought intention) to glorify and serve God, then we’re wasting our gifts. If the first time you try goes poorly, remember that your gifts, like any other skill or ability take time to cultivate. Just because you’ve been given a gift from the Holy Spirit doesn’t make you Superman or mean you’ll know how to use it. Let it be awkward and clunky at first. There’s learning that needs to take place in the process.</p>

<p>There’s a lot of mystery surrounding the Holy Spirit. I ask you to reconcile yourself to that fact and grow comfortable leaving a little room for mystery here. We first must come to terms with the fact that He has given each of us a set of gifts and it’s up to us to discover what they are, use them and cultivate them in our lives. Otherwise, we’re wasting a precious gift from God. The world can’t wait any longer. Today, we all need to begin serving God (better for some, for the first time for others) with our <em>gifts of the Spirit</em>.</p>
